MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,What is ME/CFS?,"ME/CFS is an infection-associated chronic neurological disease (G93.32). Diagnosis requires substantial functional impairment for six months or more, plus: Post-exertional malaise (PEM), Fatigue, Unrefreshing sleep, Cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. Many other symptoms are common, including pain, chills/night sweats, neuropathy, sensory sensitivity, allergies, sore throat/swollen lymph nodes, and GI symptoms. ME/CFS affects all demographics but is more frequently reported in women. Quality of life is lower than in other severe chronic illnesses, with 25% of patients housebound or bedbound. Severity can fluctuate. PEM is the pathognomonic symptom, worsening after physical or cognitive exertion. Triggers and severity vary individually and over time."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,What is Long COVID?,"Long COVID (U09.9) can develop after COVID-19, potentially lasting months, years, or life-long. It can occur regardless of acute severity or vaccination status. Approximately one in five US adults who had COVID-19 experience Long COVID symptoms, which can fluctuate or relapse. Most people with Long COVID report PEM (89% in one survey), and nearly half meet ME/CFS diagnostic criteria."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Understanding Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM),"PEM (or PESE) is symptom worsening after physical or cognitive exertion, often delayed (hours to days). Recovery can take days, weeks, or months. Patients call sudden onset of symptoms a 'crash'. PEM occurs in response to previously tolerated exertion like showering, cooking, conversations, or reading. Triggers vary daily for the same individual. Symptoms during PEM may include increased difficulty speaking/reading/communicating, increased pain/neuropathy, flu-like symptoms, and reactive sensory sensitivity. Patients may feel ""weighted down"" and have difficulty sitting up or turning in bed. PEM symptoms are unique and different from fatigue in healthy individuals. Unlike deconditioned healthy individuals who show reduced cardiac output at peak exercise, people with ME/CFS show increased cardiac output. Two-day CPET shows impaired response to exercise in people with PEM, including diminished workload and inability to increase oxygen consumption, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Warning: Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) Can Cause Harm,"GET is a clinician-supervised gradual increase in activity. It can decrease functioning in patients with PEM. Multiple patient surveys show deterioration (74% in one study, 81% in another) or no change with GET. Most patients want to be more active and need support to rest and pace, not encouragement to increase activity. The pathophysiology of PEM is not fully understood but is linked to metabolic dysfunction, endothelial response, brain function changes, orthostatic intolerance, methylation/acetylation shifts, and gut microbiome changes. Recommending gradual exercise to someone with PEM causes harm (physical and emotional), potentially irreversible, and may accelerate illness progression. Clinicians must understand that patients with PEM need encouragement to stop, rest, and pace to slow disease progression and improve quality of life."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,What can trigger post-exertional malaise?,"Identifying PEM triggers is important for management, though not all can be avoided. The goal of pacing is to minimize, not eliminate, PEM. A daily activity and symptom diary helps identify triggers, which include: Physical (daily living, work, exercise), Cognitive (reading/writing, long conversations), Sensory (loud/repetitive noises, bright/flashing lights), Emotional (challenging interactions, tragic events), Hormonal changes (e.g., menstrual cycle), Environmental (allergens, weather/seasonal/temperature changes)."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Pacing to prevent and mitigate post-exertional malaise,"There is no cure for ME/CFS or Long COVID. Data shows that people with PEM who pace have fewer symptoms, better quality of life, and are more likely to improve physical functioning and fatigue. Pacing involves assessing physical, mental, and emotional resources, accounting for uncontrollable factors, and iteratively adjusting rest and activity. A sustainable activity level differs per person and fluctuates. Patients who pace well are active when able and rest when tired. They may plan extra rest before and after strenuous activities to prevent/mitigate PEM. Proper pacing requires awareness of daily activity levels that don't trigger relapse. Patients need encouragement to stop, rest, and pace to adapt to daily living and avoid PEM. Note that 25% of ME/CFS patients are severe (housebound/bedbound). Very severe patients may have difficulty moving/communicating, and pacing may be less useful. Pacing is emotionally challenging due to accepting limitations. It also requires resources like paid sick leave, sufficient income, and social support, which are not always available due to socio-economic issues. Clinicians must consider each patient's context. Ways clinicians can help include identifying triggers, managing symptoms, and encouraging stopping, resting, and pacing."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Energy quotas,"Analogies like energy budget, energy envelope, or spoon theory can help conceptualize energy limitations. In spoon theory, a spoon is a unit of energy. People have a limited daily number of spoons. Using too many can trigger PEM."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Beyond pacing: specific activity management strategies - Cutting activity in half,"Helps find a baseline where PEM is less likely, acknowledging the baseline can change."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Beyond pacing: specific activity management strategies - Preparing for anticipated exertion,"Planning for events like weddings or lectures by pre-making meals, asking for help, and planning low-energy activities can mitigate PEM."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Beyond pacing: specific activity management strategies - Planning for unexpected PEM,"Ensuring medications are ordered, snacks/electrolytes are on hand, and clarifying expectations with others."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Beyond pacing: specific activity management strategies - Radical rest,"Being inactive before planned exertions, sometimes in a silent, dark room away from sensory stimuli, can mitigate PEM effects."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Documentation of ME/CFS and Long COVID - Document patient reported outcome measurements (PROMS),"PROMs that don't strain patients help diagnose and document fatigue/PEM. Proper documentation aids disability access. Examples include FSS and DSQ-PEM."
MEAction Pacing Guide Clinicians,Documentation of ME/CFS and Long COVID - Monitor objective values,"Correlating symptom/activity diaries with objective data (heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, HRV) can be useful. Wearable devices, oximeters, and blood pressure monitors can collect this data. Reducing activity to keep vitals normal can prevent/mitigate PEM. Devices can be set to alert when heart rate reaches a PEM-triggering value. Data can also help identify autonomic dysfunction comorbidities like POTS and OH."
