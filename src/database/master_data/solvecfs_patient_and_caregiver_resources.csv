SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,Resources for People with ME/CFS,"Long Covid & Caregivers As someone living with and managing ME/CFS or Long Covid, we know you have questions. Below are links to information about some of our most commonly asked questions. These resources are not intended to substitute individual, professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Please seek the advice of your medical provider before starting any new medication, treatment, or therapy. Solve M.E. cannot give medical or legal advice."
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,Tracking your Symptoms,"Keeping track of your symptoms through journaling or charting, especially early on, can help you identify your personal limitations and provide valuable data for your medical team. The symptoms of ME/CFS and Long Covid are many and varied. Symptoms may be constant, worse some days, better some days. Or, you may experience a symptom for a while, and then it may dissipate as a different symptom appears. If your initial tracking begins at a time when you are very ill, be kind to yourself and use whatever materials are easily available to you. Pen and paper, a monthly calendar, or cell phone calendar are all perfectly fine options."
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,Finding a Doctor,"There are only a handful of specialists and clinical centers that specialize in ME/CFS around the country. Many of them do not take insurance and most have waiting lists that can be years long. Instead of seeking out a specific specialty, many people with ME/CFS and Long Covid focus on finding doctors who are willing to be a partner in their medical care and listen to their needs. There are several resources online that can help you make a list of potential doctors. Your initial appointment with a physician should be treated like a job interview. Write your interview questions down. Keep your list of interview questions as short as possible, without compromising your ability to make an informed decision. You have the right to expect any physician to give your concerns their genuine consideration."
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,School and Work,"Your symptom journal can be an invaluable tool to use with your employer or educators. Sharing your health information with your Supervisor or Teacher could lead to their sharing your information with Human Resources, School District Administrators or vice versa. Remember, be selective about what information you share since it will likely be shared with others. One month of charting can provide a snapshot of your current condition. Multiple months of charting can provide valuable information into the progression/regression of the illness. It is important to stress to your employer, or to your child's school, how urgently you/your child want(s) to return to normal and back to work/school and identify the barriers preventing you/your child from doing so."
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,Navigating the Disability Process,"One of the most horrific effects of ME/CFS and Long Covid is the inability to work, and the often crippling loss of income. If you are unable to work, or if you feel yourself struggling to continue to work, do not hesitate to file for disability insurance. The time from applying for disability to the time of approval can take from six (6) to twelve (12) months, or longer. There are multiple sources for disability insurance in the United States. Some large corporations provide disability insurance for their employees, private disability insurance can be purchased from insurance agents - prior to the onset of illness. A few state governments provide disability insurance payments for their government employees, and the federal government provides two types of disability insurance."
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,Finances,"If you have been diagnosed with ME/CFS, Long Covid, or any chronic disease, you may be struggling or unable to work. Monetary disruption can lead to extreme stress levels, particularly if you are ill; and even more stressful if you are the sole financial support for your household. There are several important tips to help manage your financial journey: take stock of your monthly bills and outstanding debt, have a trusted confidant, and build relationships with your creditor."
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,Understanding Post Exertional Malaise (PEM):,"Understanding and managing Post Exertional Malaise (PEM), the most devastating symptom of ME/CFS and Long Covid, is unfortunately an issue in all ages and stages of persons with these diseases. PEM is the worsening of symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion, with symptoms typically worsening 12 to 48 hours after activity and lasting for days or even weeks. With ME/CFS and Long Covid, quick, easy recovery cannot be taken for granted. Often crushing fatigue - even after minor everyday exertions - is a major concern for persons living through ME/CFS and Long Covid. The kind of fatigue being considered is a relentless ""tired to the bone"" fatigue that can persist for days, even weeks and perhaps months after exertion. What is PEM, and why is it so important to discuss?"
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,The Importance of Rest,"As a person with ME/CFS or Long Covid, you need to determine your individual limits for physical and mental activity, and plan your day accordingly. Sounds easy? It's not! But, through trial and error, and careful charting of your symptoms after differing types of activities, you can find your rhythm to avoid ""crashes."" Rest is the main ingredient for reinstating your physical equilibrium. Activity Management, also called pacing, is critical to navigating life with PEM. Before you start pacing, it can be helpful to identify the activities in your life that lead to PEM."
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,Warning Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) Can Cause Harm,"Graded Exercise Therapy is NOT the same as pacing. GET requires you to increase your activity over time, potentially pushing you to repeatedly trigger the PEM response. GET has been reported by many patients to be harmful and has left some patients significantly worse than they were before they started. GET can repeatedly push a patient to the point where the PEM response is triggered, resulting in an overall (possibly permanent) worsening of symptoms."
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,Mental Health,"ME/CFS and Long Covid are not a psychiatric illness. However, it is common for people with serious medical issues to experience secondary anxiety and depression, and patients with post-infection diseases are no exception. Feelings of anger, grief, hopelessness and guilt are common as well. It is important to address the issues of loss in regard to ME/CFS and Long Covid. These diseases have so many tentacles that touch every single aspect of a person's life; it is difficult to think of any area of life these diseases do not touch. Although it is important to stay positive, it is also important to be realistic with your internal thoughts. The energy you do have is best used toward recovery, not wasted on anger and frustration."
SolveCFS Patient and Caregiver Resources,Children and Teens with ME/CFS or Long Covid,"As with adults, the degree to which a child or teen's life is impacted by the disease depends on a number of things, including disease severity. If the child is mildly affected, he or she might benefit from a slightly modified school schedule and a reduction in social activity as long as parents and guardians recognize the need to avoid triggering PEM and worsening symptoms. If the child is moderately ill, the school and parent/guardian will need to work together to establish a substantially modified plan of education which might include private tutoring, remote learning, or some type of home-schooling. Children who fall into the moderate-to-severe range are generally unable to attend school at all and need help with even the most basic personal care. It is important for family members and caregivers to know enough about the disease to understand what is happening and help guide the child's activities in order to prevent worsening of symptoms."
