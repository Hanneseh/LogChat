MEAction Pacing and Management,What is PEM?,"Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is the cardinal symptom of ME/CFS. It is a flare of symptoms or appearance of new symptoms after exertion, often delayed by 24 hours. Physical activity, cognitive overexertion, and sensory overload can all trigger PEM. PEM is unique and not the same as normal fatigue after activity."
MEAction Pacing and Management,What is pacing?,"Pacing is a self-management strategy for activity. Patients who pace well are active when able and rest when tired. They may plan extra rest before strenuous activities. Graded exercise is a clinician-supervised gradual increase in activity. It may be useful for deconditioning after surgery or severe illness but does not address the metabolic changes and atypical reactions to activity in people with ME/CFS. Because PEM is the hallmark symptom, gradually increasing exercise can be harmful. A large survey found that ~80% of people with ME/CFS found no benefit or significantly worsened on graded exercise regimens. The core symptoms of ME/CFS are not due to deconditioning. Patients with minor presentation may have activity levels similar to healthy people but still experience ME/CFS symptoms, including PEM when they overexert."
MEAction Pacing and Management,EXERTION vs. EXERCISE,"Exertion is anything that stresses or strains the system. Some stressors are controllable, others are not. Identifying PEM triggers is vital for physical and psychological well-being. Potential triggers include: Physical (exercise), Orthostatic (standing for long periods), Cognitive (long conversations, scholarly reading/writing), Sensory (loud/repetitive noises, bright/flashing lights), Emotional (challenging interactions, tragic events), Environmental (allergens, weather/seasonal changes). Not all triggers can be controlled. The goal of pacing is to minimize, not eliminate, PEM. Keeping an activity and symptom diary helps identify triggers. PEM may be delayed by ~24 hours, sometimes longer in long-standing disease, potentially increasing on a circadian cycle. This delay is important when connecting PEM to a trigger."
MEAction Pacing and Management,Beyond pacing: activity management - Radical rest,"Being inactive before planned exertions (e.g., attending a wedding) can help mitigate PEM effects. Knowing exertion is coming helps plan for worsened illness. Strategies include pre-making meals, asking for help, having snacks/medication nearby, and planning low-energy activities."
MEAction Pacing and Management,Beyond pacing: activity management - Cut activity in half,"Decreasing activity by half initially can help find a baseline, which can change over time. Avoiding PEM may help increase the baseline for some."
MEAction Pacing and Management,Beyond pacing: activity management - Monitor objective values like heart rate,"A symptom diary identifies activities leading to PEM. A wearable device can record heart rate during these activities. Reducing activity to keep heart rate below a triggering value can prevent or mitigate PEM. Devices can be programmed to alert when a certain heart rate is reached. Good pacing involves listening to your body and adjusting. If PEM occurs, decrease activity. If no PEM occurs, the 'safe' heart rate might be increased."
MEAction Pacing and Management,Beyond pacing: activity management - Break necessary activities into manageable tasks,"Avoid ""performing healthy."" Sit down, stop as needed, and speak up. Break down tasks (e.g., folding laundry items at a time, doing meal prep the day before). If walking, sit frequently and wait for heart rate to return to normal before resuming."
MEAction Pacing and Management,Beyond pacing: activity management - Prioritize activities you value & perform them differently,"When faced with a challenging activity, consider its importance, difficulty, and specificity (can others do it?). Based on this, you might drop the activity, ask someone else to do it, hire someone, do it less often, or adapt how you do it. An example of adapting socializing at a coffeehouse is provided, suggesting options like getting a ride, setting time limits, teleconferencing, or using earplugs/headphones for sensory sensitivity."
