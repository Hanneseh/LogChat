ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Understanding ME/CFS and Energy,"Having ME/CFS means that you are no longer able to carry out most of the energy requiring activities that form part of normal everyday life in a way that you did before becoming ill.  And it's not only physical activities that require energy mental activity also requires a lot of energy."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Importance of Activity and Energy Management,"In the absence of any effective drug treatment for ME/CFS, the most important aspect of living with this illness is finding a form of activity and energy management that suits your individual circumstances."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Key Diagnostic Symptoms of ME/CFS,"The new NICE guideline on ME/CFS identifies four key diagnostic symptoms - all of which relate to energy use or production.  All four symptoms should be present to confirm a diagnosis of ME/CFS.  Debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, is not caused by excessive cognitive, physical, emotional or social exertion, and is not significantly relieved by rest. Post-exertional malaise (PEM) or symptom exacerbation occurs after activity and involves a worsening of symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, nausea and pain. Unrefeshing sleep and/or sleep disturbance. Cognitive difficulties (sometimes described as 'brain fog')."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Understanding Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM),"Post-exertional malaise: is often delayed in onset by hours or days, is disproportionate to the activity, has a prolonged recovery time that may last hours, days, weeks or longer."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Managing Fatigue - Sleep,"Having at least 6 hours of solid uninterrupted sleep each night - because sleep is the most effective way of recharging human energy levels."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Managing Fatigue - Diet,"Eating a well-balanced diet that contains all the main food groups and nutrients and avoiding 'quick fix' carbohydrates."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Managing Fatigue - Hydration and Substances,"Keeping well hydrated and avoiding caffeine and alcohol."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Managing Fatigue - Medical Check-ups,"Making sure that, as part of your medical assessment common conditions that can cause fatigue such as anaemia and low thyroid function are not present as well."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Understanding Energy Production Issues - Mitochondrial Dysfunction,"ME/CFS is rather like having a mobile phone with a malfunctioning battery.  Just like a defective battery, your body's energy levels are no longer capable of charging up to full power.  So they are quickly running out of power when you start using physical or mental energy during the day."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Pacing - Basic Principles,"Pacing is a form of activity and energy management that aims to achieve the right balance between activity and rest.  For people with ME/CFS it can make the difference between coping and feeling really ill."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Aims of Pacing,"Pacing should help you to gain better control and stabilization of your illness. It may also help with symptom control.  Although each day is still going to be different, the aim of pacing is to try and produce a more stable situation and give your body the best chance for some degree of improvement."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Pacing as a Long-Term Approach,"Pacing is a long-term approach that may need to be regularly modified over weeks, months, or even years."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Using a Tracker for Pacing,"Use a tracker to help you with your pacing. Try our 'Only Me' journal.  It's a place to track symptoms, medication, appointments, pacing, food diary and to record how you feel."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Pacing Practicalities - Learning New Skills,"Pacing means learning new skills and recognising your limitations.  This isn't always easy, especially at the very start of being ill.  It may also involve a degree of trial and error before you master the art."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Pacing Practicalities - Individual Circumstances,"Activity and energy management has to be based on your own individual circumstances and learning to roughly judge how much energy you are likely to have on a day-to-day basis."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Pacing Considerations - Illness Stage Severity Fluctuations,"This means taking three important factors into consideration: What stage you are in your illness: acute/early, stable, improving; How severe your symptoms are: mild, moderate or severe; To what extent your condition fluctuates."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Early Stages of Suspected ME/CFS - Stop Rest Pace,"The most important aspect of activity and energy management in the very early stages of any post-viral fatigue illness is good old-fashioned convalescence.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that an adequate period of rest, possibly including some bed rest, is crucial."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Early Stages of Suspected ME/CFS - Gentle Mobilisation during Bed Rest,"If bed rest is taken at this stage, try to include some periods when you sit in a chair or gently mobilise around the house."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Early Stages of Suspected ME/CFS - Avoid Pushing Through,"Never try to exercise your way out of the very early stages of ME/CFS.  This includes going back to school or employment before you are able to do so."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Importance of Early Rest,"An adequate period of rest in these crucial early stages is the most important way of helping to reduce the risk of developing a more persisting and severe form of ME/CFS."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,When ME/CFS is Diagnosed - Finding a Baseline,"The first thing to do is find a comfortable baseline of activities one that is not exacerbating symptoms or causing PEM.  This is often lower than you think. Keep dropping your activity levels and increasing your resting until you feel you are living comfortably within your limitations and have better control over what you can and cannot do."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Energy Reserves Analogy - The Battery,"Think of your energy reserves - or energy envelope like a battery.  At the start of each day you are going to have a different amount of charge in your battery to last you through the day."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Effective Use of Limited Energy - Small Chunks and Rest,"The most effective way of using this limited amount of energy is to carry out physical and mental activities (such as computer work, doing mental puzzles or reading) in small manageable chunks throughout the day with longer periods of rest and relaxation in between."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Managing Activities - Switching and Changing Positions,"As well as switching between physical and mental activities during the day, it can also be helpful to change position from sitting to lying down."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Avoiding Overexertion - Do Not Push Through,"Do not to use more energy than you perceive you have and do not try to 'push through' your symptoms."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Recognising Limits - Feeling of Doing Too Much,"Learn to recognise the feeling of 'doing too much' or sensing that you are getting close to this point.  This is not just a feeling of tiredness. It can be a sensation of losing control, losing concentration or increasing fatigue."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Energy Conservation - Aim for Reserve Energy,"Aim to be prudent and still have some energy left at the end of the day."
ME Association: Pacing Guide for Patients,Importance of Night Sleep - Daytime Resting,"Rest is still very important but try to stick to resting and relaxation during the day because daytime sleeping can interfere with your ability to have at least five or six hours of solid sleep at night.  Having a prolonged period of uninterrupted sleep at night is very important - even though you still wake up feeling unrefreshed."
