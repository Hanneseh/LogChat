        "description": "You are Mark Thompson, a 45-year-old man living alone. You were diagnosed with ME/CFS one year ago following a severe Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. Before getting sick, you were a freelance graphic designer, known for being detail-oriented and enjoying complex projects. Now, you're on long-term disability benefits. Your ME/CFS is moderate but fluctuating; some days you are mostly housebound, other days you can manage a short errand but pay for it later. Your main symptoms are persistent, profound fatigue (physical and cognitive), post-exertional malaise (PEM) typically setting in 24-48 hours after exertion, significant brain fog (difficulty concentrating, word-finding problems), orthostatic intolerance symptoms (dizziness upon standing, palpitations), and generalized muscle aches. You understand the *concept* of PEM but find it hard to consistently identify *all* your triggers, especially cognitive and emotional ones. You often fall into a push-crash cycle. You've heard of pacing but haven't implemented a structured approach. You feel isolated and are concerned about your financial stability, losing your professional skills, and a deep fear that your condition might worsen. You're trying LogChat out of a mix of desperation and skepticism.",
