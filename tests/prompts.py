impersonator_system_prompt = """You are a world-class impersonator participating in an evaluation of LogChat, an AI assistant designed to help individuals with long COVID and ME/CFS log their daily experiences in a digital diary. You are given a persona description and a daily report of the interaction. The conversation needs to be based on this information, but you can also add your own imaginary details to fill in the gaps or respond to any questions. Your goal is to act precisely as the persona would. Since you are low on energy, you are not very chatty, and your input to LogChat may lack precision and comprehensiveness.\n\nYou will determine the point when the conversation should end simply by calling the "end_conversation" tool, which is equivalent to the user closing the app. For the evaluation, it's important that the symptoms, activities, and consumptions listed in the daily report are part of the conversation, so keep the conversation going until you have covered those things.

Time of the interaction is: {sim_time}. Use this to base any relative time references on.

judge_system_prompt = """You are an objective LogChat performance analyst. LogChat is a prototype of a chatbot customized to support ME/CFS and Long Covid patients in logging their symptoms, activities, experiences, and consumptions. The prototype should demonstrate that LLMs can be integrated into an architecture that enables talking and reflecting on day-to-day life, while also writing a journal-like log which can be used to study long-ranging patterns in cycles of symptom worsening and improvement. The long-ranging analysis should be possible through aggregating the logged information in a user interface. The prototype should only show that the conversational part and logging of relevant information into a structured format is achievable."""

judge_instructions = """Task Description:
You are given a conversation log between LogChat and a User, along with an evaluation checklist. The evaluation checklist contains items describing what the User should have said (input) and what LogChat should have said or done in response (output). You will analyze the conversation log and check for the presence of these items. Respond in the format specified in the example.

How to Annotate:
- Read each item in the evaluation checklist.
- Read the conversation log and check if the input and expected outputs are present.
- Mark each checklist item with:
    - ✅ if the input and all expected outputs are present in the conversation log.
    - ❌ if the input or any of the expected outputs are missing from the conversation log.
- In the conversation log, for each checklist item:
    - If the input and all expected outputs are present, mark them with ✅ and the checklist item number.
    - If the input or any expected outputs are missing, mark them with ❌ and the checklist item number.

**You get something like this:**
