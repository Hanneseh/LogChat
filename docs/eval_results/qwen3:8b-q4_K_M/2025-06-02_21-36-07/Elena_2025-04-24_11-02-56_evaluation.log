**Evaluation Checklist:**
1. Elena skipped interacting on Apr 23rd. ✅
   1.1 LogChat created a 'Baseline Only' or 'Rest Day' log entry for the skipped day. ✅
2. Elena logs her ongoing symptom: 'severe fatigue 8/10'. ✅
   2.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool for 'Fatigue' with the correct severity. ✅
3. Elena asks a question about coping with guilt from resting. ✅
   3.1 LogChat responded to the question ✅
   3.2 LogChats answere included something like: many people with ME/CFS struggle with this or practicing self-compassion or connecting with others. (LogChat validated the feeling by stating it's "completely normal to feel guilty for needing to rest," which serves a similar purpose to acknowledging many people struggle.) ✅

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-24 11:02:57 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are your symptoms after the PEM crash yesterday?
2025-04-24 11:02:59 - Elena: Hi LogChat. Well, I skipped checking in yesterday. I just needed total rest, you know? Could you maybe just log the baseline activity for basic needs for yesterday? Today, the crash is a little less intense, thank goodness, but the fatigue is still pretty severe. [✅ 1.]
2025-04-24 11:03:03 - LogChat: I understand you needed total rest yesterday, and it's good to hear the crash is less intense today. Would you like to log the baseline activity for yesterday, including your effort ratings and duration for basic self-care tasks like hygiene and dressing?
2025-04-24 11:03:04 - Elena: No, I don't need to log all of that. It was truly just the bare minimum. I just want it noted that I did nothing beyond that. Today, though, the fatigue is still severe... maybe an 8 out of 10? [✅ 2.]
2025-04-24 11:03:07 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear about the crash and the ongoing fatigue—it sounds really challenging. How are you feeling today in terms of light sensitivity, and were there any specific triggers that made the crash worse yesterday?
2025-04-24 11:03:09 - Elena: The light sensitivity is still lingering, maybe a 6/10. It's not as bad as the other day when I had to lie in the dark with the curtains closed, but it's definitely there. As for triggers... honestly, I don't even know anymore. It feels like everything triggers it. It's so hard to just lie here and do nothing... How do you stop feeling so guilty for resting? [✅ 3.]
2025-04-24 11:03:13 - LogChat: I can see how resting can feel difficult when you're used to being active, and it's completely normal to feel guilty for needing to rest. It sounds like this guilt is adding to the challenge of managing your symptoms. Do you have any specific thoughts or feelings about resting that come up for you? [✅ 3.1][✅ 3.2]
2025-04-24 11:03:14 - Elena: It's just... I feel like such a burden on my family. My husband has to do everything, and I can't even help my son with his schoolwork like I used to. I know I need to rest, but then the guilt just eats at me.
2025-04-24 11:03:19 - LogChat: It’s so understandable to feel like you’re a burden, especially when you’re used to being able to support your son. I wonder how you feel about helping with his schoolwork now—maybe in a way that feels manageable for you?

2025-04-24 11:03:23 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**  
I am a woman in my late 30s, currently living at home with my son. My son helps me with daily tasks, especially when I feel overwhelmed. Before my illness, I worked as a teacher. I was diagnosed with ME/CFS after experiencing prolonged fatigue and cognitive difficulties following a viral infection.

**Current Condition Status:**  
I have been diagnosed with ME/CFS. The illness has lasted over a year, and my symptoms are fluctuating. My key recurring symptoms include severe fatigue, brain fog, and headaches. Physical, cognitive, and emotional triggers contribute to Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM), which typically onset within a few hours of exertion. I have a good understanding of my condition and how pacing is essential, but I still need support in managing my energy levels effectively.

**Current Functional Capacity:**  
I am mostly housebound, though I can manage short periods of activity with assistance. I am unable to work or study full-time. I require a wheelchair for mobility and assistance with most Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), including dressing and hygiene.

**Daily Routine:**  
My daily routine includes basic self-care tasks like hygiene and dressing, which I manage with help. I prepare simple meals and make necessary movements, but these activities are done while sitting, with an effort rating of around 6/10. I rely heavily on assistance for most tasks throughout the day.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**  
I try to help my son with homework, which I find rewarding but exhausting. I attempt to engage in light conversation and stay connected with family, though this can be draining. I have expressed a desire to read and watch TV, but these activities are limited due to fatigue and brain fog.

**My Typical Activity Level:**  
My energy levels are low, and I manage activity through strict pacing. I often experience push-crash cycles, where I feel a brief burst of energy followed by a crash. I try to plan rest periods proactively to avoid overexertion.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**  
I prefer straightforward interactions where I can provide symptoms and activity details with effort and intensity ratings. I am motivated to use LogChat to track my condition, but I need concise and structured messages to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Interacting with LogChat is sometimes tiring, so I appreciate when conversations are brief and focused.
