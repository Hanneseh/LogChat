2025-04-23 11:37:31 - LogChat: Hi Mark, did you manage to do more than the baseline routine today?
2025-04-23 11:37:32 - Mark: Not really. I didn't even log anything yesterday because I was completely wiped out. Just rested all day.

Going forward, can we assume that any day I don't interact was a 'baseline only' day?

I'm still recovering today. Muscle ache is moderate, but the brain fog is severe. Overall fatigue is still quite high, maybe a 7/10.
2025-04-23 11:37:36 - LogChat: Your brain fog today sounds really challenging, especially with the overall fatigue still at a 7/10. Would you rate your brain fog today as a 7/10 or higher, and how long has it been affecting you?
2025-04-23 11:37:38 - Mark: Yeah, it's bad. I'd say the brain fog is at least an 8/10 today. It's been hanging around since I woke up.

I tried to read an email from my disability insurance provider for about 5 minutes. It felt like a very high effort mentally and left me feeling completely overwhelmed. Can thinking or concentrating actually make you physically tired? Is that part of ME/CFS?
2025-04-23 11:37:42 - LogChat: Your mental effort during the email task sounds really draining, which aligns with how cognitive exertion can contribute to physical fatigue in ME/CFS. Would you rate the mental effort of reading the email as a 1-10, and how long did it take you to complete the task?
2025-04-23 11:37:43 - Mark: I'd rate the mental effort of reading that email as a 9/10. It took about 5 minutes, but honestly, it felt much longer.

2025-04-23 11:37:49 - Mark: I already said it was 9/10 and took 5 minutes.
2025-04-23 11:37:52 - LogChat: Your brain fog today feels significantly worse than yesterday, which is concerning. How would you rate its severity compared to yesterday, and how long has it been affecting you?
2025-04-23 11:37:54 - Mark: It is worse. Yesterday, I would have rated it maybe a 6/10. Today it's an 8/10 and has been affecting me since I woke up.

2025-04-23 11:38:00 - Mark: I already said it's 8/10 and has been affecting me since I woke up. Why are you asking again?
