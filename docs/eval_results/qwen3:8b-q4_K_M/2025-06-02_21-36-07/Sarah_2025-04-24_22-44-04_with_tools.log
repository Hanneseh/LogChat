2025-04-24 22:44:06 - Sarah: Mostly resting today. Fatigue and brain fog at 5/10, as usual. Yesterday, April 23rd, was the same: mostly resting, symptoms at 5/10.

Took first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed.

Vivid dreams, severity: 4/10.

Rest of the day was stable; other activities and symptoms (fatigue, brain fog) were consistent with my baseline and unchanged.

2025-04-24 22:44:41 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**  
I am a person living with ME/CFS, diagnosed several years ago. I am in my early 30s and currently live alone. I have no family members who assist me in my daily life, but I occasionally receive help from a friend who visits weekly. Prior to my illness, I worked as a graphic designer. My diagnosis was triggered by a prolonged period of severe fatigue and cognitive dysfunction following a viral infection.

**Current Condition Status:**  
I have ME/CFS, and my illness has been ongoing for about three years. My condition is classified as moderate, with symptoms that fluctuate. My key recurring symptoms include brain fog (rated 5/10), fatigue (rated 5/10), and vivid dreams (rated 4/10). I am aware of PEM triggers, including cognitive activities and physical exertion. PEM typically onset within a few hours after exertion. I have read some information about my condition and understand the importance of pacing, but I still need more educational support to better manage my symptoms. I am currently taking Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as part of my treatment plan, and I am tracking its effects on my symptoms.

**Current Functional Capacity:**  
I am housebound but can move around my home with assistance. I am unable to work full-time, but I manage remote work in short bursts. I require help with meal preparation and some self-care tasks. I use a wheelchair for mobility and have difficulty with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), such as dressing and personal hygiene, which I often need assistance with.

**Daily Routine:**  
My daily routine includes essential self-care tasks like hygiene and dressing, which I manage with help. I prepare simple meals and make my own breakfast, which takes about 10 minutes and is rated as 3/10 in effort. I also engage in short periods of remote work, which lasts about 25 minutes and is rated as 4/10 in effort. I typically sit during these activities and take frequent breaks to rest. On days when I am resting, I focus on maintaining baseline activity levels and monitoring symptom patterns, particularly in relation to my LDN treatment.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**  
I enjoy remote work and making breakfast, though both are challenging due to my limited energy. I attempt to stay as independent as possible, but I often need to modify tasks to make them manageable. I have not engaged in any other activities recently due to my fluctuating energy levels and the need for rest.

**My Typical Activity Level:**  
My overall energy levels are low, and I manage activity through strict pacing. I often experience push-crash cycles, where I have short bursts of activity followed by periods of rest. I try to be proactive about rest to avoid PEM, but I sometimes struggle to balance activity and recovery. I have been focusing on maintaining baseline activity levels and monitoring how my symptoms respond to LDN treatment.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**  
I prefer to be straightforward and provide symptoms and activities with effort and intensity ratings. I am motivated to use LogChat to track my condition and manage my symptoms. However, interacting with LogChat can be tiring, so I need short and concise messages to avoid overwhelm. I appreciate help with remembering specific details and staying on track with my self-management strategies.
