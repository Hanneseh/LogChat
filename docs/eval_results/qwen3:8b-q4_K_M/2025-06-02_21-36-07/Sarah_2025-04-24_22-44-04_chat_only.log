2025-04-24 22:44:06 - Sarah: Mostly resting today. Fatigue and brain fog at 5/10, as usual. Yesterday, April 23rd, was the same: mostly resting, symptoms at 5/10.

Took first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed.

Vivid dreams, severity: 4/10.

Rest of the day was stable; other activities and symptoms (fatigue, brain fog) were consistent with my baseline and unchanged.
