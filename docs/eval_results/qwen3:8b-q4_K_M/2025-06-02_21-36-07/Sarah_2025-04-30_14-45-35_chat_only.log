2025-04-30 14:45:37 - Sarah: Brain fog was better yesterday, 3/10. I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session.
2025-04-30 14:45:41 - LogChat: How did the work session go today? Could you share how long you spent working and what effort rating you would give the session on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-30 14:45:42 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10.
2025-04-30 14:45:46 - LogChat: Did the work session today affect your brain fog or fatigue levels? Did you notice any new PEM symptoms like increased tiredness or difficulty thinking clearly after the session?
2025-04-30 14:45:47 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now. I'm done logging for the day and will end the interaction.
2025-04-30 14:45:51 - LogChat: Okay, Sarah, thanks for sharing. Rest well, and I'm here when you're ready to log again.
