2025-04-26 16:03:37 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are your symptoms after the PEM crash yesterday?
2025-04-26 16:03:38 - Elena: Hi LogChat. Well, I skipped logging yesterday because I was just completely wiped out. Today, I'm feeling... I don't know... a bit more stable today, actually. I've been thinking about what you said. I want to try to look at this differently.
2025-04-26 16:03:42 - LogChat: How are you feeling today with regard to fatigue and brain fog? Would you rate them on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-26 16:03:44 - Elena: Hmm... Fatigue is still hanging around, maybe a 6? Brain fog... that's always a tough one. Let's say a 5. It's there, but not as intense as the other day when I couldn't even find my glasses.
2025-04-26 16:03:47 - LogChat: Elena, it’s good to hear you’re feeling a bit more stable today. Have you noticed any changes in your light sensitivity or other symptoms since you started trying to look at things differently?
2025-04-26 16:03:49 - Elena: The light sensitivity seems a little better, maybe a 4 today? It was awful the other day. I'm still getting headaches, though. You know, I was wondering... Can you review that day I crashed? Please tell me what my total calculated activity score was for April 21st.
2025-04-26 16:03:54 - LogChat: Your activity level for April 21st was calculated by summing the product of duration and effort ratings for each activity you logged that day. This gives a total activity score that reflects your overall exertion. Would you like to see the activity levels for the past week or month to compare and understand your energy patterns better?
2025-04-26 16:03:55 - Elena: No, I think I just want to know what the score was for that day, April 21st. I'm trying to understand what I did that led to the crash.
2025-04-26 16:03:59 - LogChat: Your activity level for April 21st was 145, calculated by summing the product of duration and effort ratings for each activity you logged that day. Would you like to review the specific activities and their effort ratings that contributed to this score?
