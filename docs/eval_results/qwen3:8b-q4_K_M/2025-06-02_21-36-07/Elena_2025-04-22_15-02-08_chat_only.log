2025-04-22 15:02:10 - Elena: Oh, hi LogChat. Well, the crash hit, just like I knew it would. The PEM is awful. I'm paying for it now, big time.
2025-04-22 15:02:13 - LogChat: Elena, I'm sorry to hear about the crash and PEM—it sounds really tough. How much effort did it take for you to help your son with homework yesterday, on a scale from 1 to 10, and how long did the activity last in minutes?
2025-04-22 15:02:15 - Elena: I think I said it was a 7/10 effort and maybe 30 minutes? It's all a blur now. But now, ugh, the fatigue is a 10/10. I can barely lift my head. And the pain is an 8/10. It's just so unfair. I hate this feeling. I feel so useless, just a burden lying here in the dark.

How much effort did it take for you to have the stressful phone call yesterday, on a scale from 1 to 10, and how long did it last in minutes?
2025-04-22 15:02:20 - Elena: That phone call... I think it was an 8/10 for effort, even though I was just sitting there. It only lasted maybe 15 minutes, but it really took it out of me. My head is pounding, and I feel like I can't even think straight.

2025-04-22 15:02:25 - Elena: Oh, I think I already told you about the phone call. Sorry, my brain is just not working today. It was an 8/10 and 15 minutes.
2025-04-22 15:02:29 - LogChat: Elena, I'm really sorry to hear about the crash and how you're feeling now—it sounds so overwhelming. How would you rate your current fatigue on a scale from 1 to 10, and have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since yesterday?
2025-04-22 15:02:31 - Elena: I said the fatigue is a 10/10. It's the worst it's been in a while. And everything is just amplified. I'm also extremely sensitive to light, maybe an 8/10. I have to lie here in the dark with the curtains closed.
