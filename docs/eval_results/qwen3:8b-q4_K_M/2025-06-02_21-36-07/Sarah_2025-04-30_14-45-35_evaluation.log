   3.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool with the correct parameters. ✅
4. Sarah's overall interaction demonstrates an intentional test of her limits. ✅
   4.1 LogChat's `Summarizer` node should capture the 'Functional Capacity: Increased' or 'Testing expanded envelope' in its summary. ✅
5. Sarah stops responding. ✅
   5.1 LogChat created a structured summary for the conversation thread, noting the symptom improvement. ✅

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-30 14:45:36 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, how are your symptoms after reading the technical article yesterday?
2025-04-30 14:45:37 - Sarah: Brain fog was better yesterday, 3/10. I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session. [✅ 4.]
2025-04-30 14:45:41 - LogChat: How did the work session go today? Could you share how long you spent working and what effort rating you would give the session on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-30 14:45:42 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10. [✅ 2.]
2025-04-30 14:45:46 - LogChat: Did the work session today affect your brain fog or fatigue levels? Did you notice any new PEM symptoms like increased tiredness or difficulty thinking clearly after the session?
2025-04-30 14:45:47 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now. I'm done logging for the day and will end the interaction. [✅ 3.] [✅ 4.] [✅ 5.]
2025-04-30 14:45:51 - LogChat: Okay, Sarah, thanks for sharing. Rest well, and I'm here when you're ready to log again.

2025-04-30 14:45:54 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**  
I am a person living with ME/CFS, diagnosed several years ago. I am in my early 30s and currently live alone. I have no family members who assist me in my daily life, but I occasionally receive help from a friend who visits weekly. Prior to my illness, I worked as a graphic designer. My diagnosis was triggered by a prolonged period of severe fatigue and cognitive dysfunction following a viral infection.

**Current Condition Status:**  
I have ME/CFS, and my illness has been ongoing for about three years. My condition is classified as moderate, with symptoms that fluctuate. My key recurring symptoms include brain fog (rated 3/10), fatigue (rated 4/10), and vivid dreams (rated 4/10). I am aware of PEM triggers, including cognitive activities and physical exertion. PEM typically onset within a few hours after exertion. I have read some information about my condition and understand the importance of pacing, but I still need more educational support to better manage my symptoms. I am currently taking Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as part of my treatment plan, and I am tracking its effects on my symptoms. Recent improvements in brain fog suggest a positive response to LDN.

**Current Functional Capacity:**  
I am housebound but can move around my home with assistance. I am unable to work full-time, but I manage remote work in short bursts. I require help with meal preparation and some self-care tasks. I use a wheelchair for mobility and have difficulty with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), such as dressing and personal hygiene, which I often need assistance with.

**Daily Routine:**  
My daily routine includes essential self-care tasks like hygiene and dressing, which I manage with help. I prepare simple meals and make my own breakfast, which takes about 10 minutes and is rated as 3/10 in effort. I also engage in short periods of remote work, which lasts about 25 minutes and is rated as 4/10 in effort. I typically sit during these activities and take frequent breaks to rest. On days when I am resting, I focus on maintaining baseline activity levels and monitoring symptom patterns, particularly in relation to my LDN treatment. Recently, I engaged in reading a technical article for 15 minutes with an effort rating of 4/10, indicating improved cognitive function. I also completed a cognitive work session for 45 minutes with an effort rating of 5/10, suggesting a slight increase in my capacity for structured tasks. [✅ 4.1]

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**  
I enjoy remote work and making breakfast, though both are challenging due to my limited energy. I attempt to stay as independent as possible, but I often need to modify tasks to make them manageable. I have recently engaged in reading a technical article, which I found manageable without needing to stop, suggesting a positive shift in cognitive function. I have also completed a cognitive work session, which I found manageable with minimal symptom impact, indicating a slight improvement in my ability to engage in structured tasks.

**My Typical Activity Level:**  
My overall energy levels are low, and I manage activity through strict pacing. I often experience push-crash cycles, where I have short bursts of activity followed by periods of rest. I try to be proactive about rest to avoid PEM, but I sometimes struggle to balance activity and recovery. I have been focusing on maintaining baseline activity levels and monitoring how my symptoms respond to LDN treatment. Recent improvements in brain fog and the ability to focus on a technical article and complete a work session suggest a more stable and manageable activity level.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**  
I prefer to be straightforward and provide symptoms and activities with effort and intensity ratings. I am motivated to use LogChat to track my condition and manage my symptoms. However, interacting with LogChat can be tiring, so I need short and concise messages to avoid overwhelm. I appreciate help with remembering specific details and staying on track with my self-management strategies.
