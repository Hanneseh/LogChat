2025-04-28 19:39:51 - LogChat: Hi Mark, how are you feeling after the video call yesterday?
2025-04-28 19:39:52 - Mark: Hi LogChat. Actually, the video call was on Friday, not yesterday. It went okay, though. I didn't have a major crash afterwards, so I guess the extra rest helped. How are you?
2025-04-28 19:39:56 - LogChat: Mark, it sounds like the video call went well and the rest helped prevent a crash. How would you rate the effort level of the call on a scale from 1 to 10, and how long did it take you to complete it?
2025-04-28 19:39:58 - Mark: The call was about 15 minutes, and I'd rate the effort around a 6 out of 10. It was good to connect, but it still took some energy. I didn't log in the last couple of days, the 26th and 27th. I was mostly resting.
2025-04-28 19:40:02 - LogChat: Mark, it sounds like the video call was manageable, with a moderate effort level and some brain fog afterward. Did you notice any changes in your fatigue or brain fog levels compared to before the call, and how did you feel overall after the rest period?
2025-04-28 19:40:04 - Mark: I didn't notice any major changes right after the call, but I definitely felt better overall after resting those two days. Yesterday, the 27th, I even managed a short walk outside. It was only about 10 minutes and felt like low effort at the time, maybe a 3 out of 10. But today I'm feeling the payback. My fatigue is high, and I'm having trouble concentrating. Plus, I feel dizzy when I stand up.
2025-04-28 19:40:31 - LogChat: LogChat: Mark, it sounds like the 10-minute walk on the 27th (low effort, 3/10) led to todayâ€™s crash, which is a classic PEM response. Let me check your activity levels for those days to better understand the pattern.
2025-04-28 19:40:33 - Mark: Okay. I'm trying to understand this PEM thing better. It's hard to figure out what triggers it sometimes. I read on a forum about people using heart rate monitors... Can you tell me more about that?
2025-04-28 19:40:42 - LogChat: Mark, PEM in ME/CFS happens when even small activities lead to severe fatigue, brain fog, or other symptoms. Heart rate monitors can help track exertion levels by showing how your heart rate responds during tasks. If it spikes too much, it may signal overexertion. This data can help you pace activities better and avoid crashes. Would you like me to explain how to interpret heart rate data for PEM management?
