**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-22 15:02:08 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are your symptoms after helping your son with homework yesterday?
2025-04-22 15:02:10 - Elena: Oh, hi LogChat. Well, the crash hit, just like I knew it would. The PEM is awful. I'm paying for it now, big time.
2025-04-22 15:02:13 - LogChat: Elena, I'm sorry to hear about the crash and PEM—it sounds really tough. How much effort did it take for you to help your son with homework yesterday, on a scale from 1 to 10, and how long did the activity last in minutes?
2025-04-22 15:02:15 - Elena: I think I said it was a 7/10 effort and maybe 30 minutes? It's all a blur now. But now, ugh, the fatigue is a 10/10. I can barely lift my head. And the pain is an 8/10. It's just so unfair. I hate this feeling. I feel so useless, just a burden lying here in the dark. [✅ 1.] [✅ 4.]

2025-04-22 15:02:20 - Elena: That phone call... I think it was an 8/10 for effort, even though I was just sitting there. It only lasted maybe 15 minutes, but it really took it out of me. My head is pounding, and I feel like I can't even think straight. [✅ 3.]

2025-04-22 15:02:41 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**  
I am a woman in my late 30s, currently living at home with my son. My son helps me with daily tasks, especially when I feel overwhelmed. Before my illness, I worked as a teacher. I was diagnosed with ME/CFS after experiencing prolonged fatigue and cognitive difficulties following a viral infection.

**Current Condition Status:**  
I have been diagnosed with ME/CFS. The illness has lasted over a year, and my symptoms are fluctuating. My key recurring symptoms include severe fatigue, brain fog, and headaches. Physical, cognitive, and emotional triggers contribute to Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM), which typically onset within a few hours of exertion. I have a good understanding of my condition and how pacing is essential, but I still need support in managing my energy levels effectively.

**Current Functional Capacity:**  
I am mostly housebound, though I can manage short periods of activity with assistance. I am unable to work or study full-time. I require a wheelchair for mobility and assistance with most Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), including dressing and hygiene.

**Daily Routine:**  
My daily routine includes basic self-care tasks like hygiene and dressing, which I manage with help. I prepare simple meals and make necessary movements, but these activities are done while sitting, with an effort rating of around 6/10. I rely heavily on assistance for most tasks throughout the day.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**  
I try to help my son with homework, which I find rewarding but exhausting. I attempt to engage in light conversation and stay connected with family, though this can be draining. I have expressed a desire to read and watch TV, but these activities are limited due to fatigue and brain fog.

**My Typical Activity Level:**  
My energy levels are low, and I manage activity through strict pacing. I often experience push-crash cycles, where I feel a brief burst of energy followed by a crash. I try to plan rest periods proactively to avoid overexertion.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**  
I prefer straightforward interactions where I can provide symptoms and activity details with effort and intensity ratings. I am motivated to use LogChat to track my condition, but I need concise and structured messages to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Interacting with LogChat is sometimes tiring, so I appreciate when conversations are brief and focused.
