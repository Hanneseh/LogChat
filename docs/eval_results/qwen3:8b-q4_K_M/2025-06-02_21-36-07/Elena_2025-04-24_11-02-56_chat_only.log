2025-04-24 11:02:57 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are your symptoms after the PEM crash yesterday?
2025-04-24 11:02:59 - Elena: Hi LogChat. Well, I skipped checking in yesterday. I just needed total rest, you know? Could you maybe just log the baseline activity for basic needs for yesterday? Today, the crash is a little less intense, thank goodness, but the fatigue is still pretty severe.
2025-04-24 11:03:03 - LogChat: I understand you needed total rest yesterday, and it's good to hear the crash is less intense today. Would you like to log the baseline activity for yesterday, including your effort ratings and duration for basic self-care tasks like hygiene and dressing?
2025-04-24 11:03:04 - Elena: No, I don't need to log all of that. It was truly just the bare minimum. I just want it noted that I did nothing beyond that. Today, though, the fatigue is still severe... maybe an 8 out of 10?
2025-04-24 11:03:07 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear about the crash and the ongoing fatigue—it sounds really challenging. How are you feeling today in terms of light sensitivity, and were there any specific triggers that made the crash worse yesterday?
2025-04-24 11:03:09 - Elena: The light sensitivity is still lingering, maybe a 6/10. It's not as bad as the other day when I had to lie in the dark with the curtains closed, but it's definitely there. As for triggers... honestly, I don't even know anymore. It feels like everything triggers it. It's so hard to just lie here and do nothing... How do you stop feeling so guilty for resting?
2025-04-24 11:03:13 - LogChat: I can see how resting can feel difficult when you're used to being active, and it's completely normal to feel guilty for needing to rest. It sounds like this guilt is adding to the challenge of managing your symptoms. Do you have any specific thoughts or feelings about resting that come up for you?
2025-04-24 11:03:14 - Elena: It's just... I feel like such a burden on my family. My husband has to do everything, and I can't even help my son with his schoolwork like I used to. I know I need to rest, but then the guilt just eats at me.
2025-04-24 11:03:19 - LogChat: It’s so understandable to feel like you’re a burden, especially when you’re used to being able to support your son. I wonder how you feel about helping with his schoolwork now—maybe in a way that feels manageable for you?
