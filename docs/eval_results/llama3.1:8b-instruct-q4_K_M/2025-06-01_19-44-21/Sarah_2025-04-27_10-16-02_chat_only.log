2025-04-27 10:16:08 - Sarah: No crash yesterday. I think the LDN might be having a positive effect. My brain fog feels less severe today.
2025-04-27 10:16:43 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, it seems that your average daily activity score for the past few weeks has been around 166.7, indicating a moderate level of activity on days when you were active. Considering this, do you think there's a correlation between your perceived improvement in brain fog severity today and your average daily activity score during this period?
2025-04-27 10:16:44 - Sarah: I don't think so. I've been pacing pretty consistently. Please log symptom: Brain fog, severity: 3/10. That's a two-point improvement. I also read a technical article for 15 minutes. Note the effort was only a 4/10, which is lower than it would have been before.
2025-04-27 10:17:18 - LogChat: Based on your consistent pacing, it seems that your activity levels have been relatively stable lately. Considering this, I'd like to ask: Do you think the perceived improvement in brain fog severity today is related to any specific activities or changes you've made recently, such as reading the technical article for 15 minutes with a lower effort rating of 4/10?
