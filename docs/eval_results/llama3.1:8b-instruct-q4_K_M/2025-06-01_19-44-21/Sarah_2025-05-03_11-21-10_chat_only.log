2025-05-03 11:21:17 - Sarah: I'm stable. Fatigue is at 3/10. Brain fog is 2/10. I'd like to use the data to verify my perceived improvements. I need you to retrieve some activity scores.
2025-05-03 11:21:51 - LogChat: Based on the Planner's suggestion, I'd like to present the retrieved activity level data for comparison with your perceived improvements in managing fatigue and brain fog. Your average daily score from April 27th onwards is significantly lower compared to previous days, dropping from 180.0 to 0.0. Does this numerical difference align with your feelings about managing fatigue and brain fog?
2025-05-03 11:21:52 - Sarah: Can you retrieve my calculated activity score for April 22nd? That was a baseline day before I started the medication.

Now, regarding meal preparation, how much effort did it take you to prepare breakfast today, on a scale from 1 (very easy) to 10 (extremely challenging)?
2025-05-03 11:22:16 - Sarah: Now, can you retrieve the activity score for April 30th, the day I did the longer work session?
2025-05-03 11:22:48 - LogChat: Based on the Planner's suggestion, I'd like to ask if the retrieved activity score for April 22nd aligns with your memory of that day, considering it was a baseline before starting medication. On a scale from 1 (very easy) to 10 (extremely challenging), how would you rate the effort of preparing breakfast today?
2025-05-03 11:22:49 - Sarah: Perfect. Please show me the comparison of those two scores.
