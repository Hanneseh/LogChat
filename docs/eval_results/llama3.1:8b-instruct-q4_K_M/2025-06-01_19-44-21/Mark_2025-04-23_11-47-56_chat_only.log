2025-04-23 11:48:00 - LogChat: Hi Mark, we haven't talked for a few days. How have you been?
2025-04-23 11:48:01 - Mark: Not great, to be honest. I didn't log anything yesterday because I was completely wiped out and just rested all day. Can we assume that any day I don't interact is a "baseline only" day? Today I'm still recovering. My muscle ache is moderate, but the brain fog is severe. Overall fatigue is still quite high, maybe a 7/10.
2025-04-23 11:48:22 - LogChat: Based on your description of being wiped out yesterday, I'm assuming that day was a baseline only day. Today, you're still recovering with moderate muscle ache but severe brain fog. Considering the muscle ache is currently at a moderate level, would you rate its severity higher than 6/10?
2025-04-23 11:48:23 - Mark: No, I'd say it's around a 5/10 right now. The brain fog is the worst thing today. I tried to read an email from my disability insurance provider for about 5 minutes, which felt like a very high effort mentally and left me feeling completely overwhelmed. Can thinking or concentrating actually make you physically tired? Is that part of ME/CFS?

Also, how would you rate the intensity of your brain fog today on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-23 11:48:51 - Mark: I'd rate the brain fog as an 8/10.

Also, how would you rate the intensity of your brain fog today on a scale from 1 to 10, and can you estimate how long it lasted in minutes or hours?
2025-04-23 11:49:29 - Mark: The brain fog has been pretty constant all morning, so about 3 hours so far.
2025-04-23 11:50:03 - LogChat: Based on your description of trying to read an email from your disability insurance provider, which felt like a very high effort mentally and left you feeling completely overwhelmed, I'd like to clarify that thinking or concentrating can indeed make you physically tired. This is often referred to as post-exertional malaise (PEM) in ME/CFS, where mental exertion can lead to a worsening of symptoms.

How long did trying to read the email last, and on a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the intensity of that mental effort?
2025-04-23 11:50:04 - Mark: I said it lasted about 5 minutes. I'd rate the mental effort as a 9/10.
