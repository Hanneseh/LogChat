Considering this and your new energy envelope, how does your current work session align with what you expected in terms of effort level and duration?

2025-04-30 14:20:18 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am a person living with ME/CFS and Long COVID. I am currently 35 years old, and my illness has been ongoing for about 2 years now. My symptoms have been fluctuating in severity over time. I live alone but have a support system of friends who help me with daily tasks when needed.

**Current Condition Status:**
I have been diagnosed with ME/CFS and Long COVID. The typical severity of my symptoms is moderate to severe, with some days being better than others. My key recurring symptoms include brain fog (severity 5/10), fatigue (severity 4-5/10), muscle pain, joint pain, sleep disturbances, and vivid dreams. I experience PEM triggers from physical activities, cognitive tasks, and emotional stressors. The typical onset timing of my PEM is immediate after exertion.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am currently housebound due to the severity of my symptoms. I am unable to work full-time but try to engage in remote work for short periods when possible (about 25 minutes with an effort level of 4/10). I require assistance with mobility and have a wheelchair for use when needed.

**Daily Routine:**
My daily routine includes essential self-care activities like hygiene and dressing, which take about 30 minutes each. I also prepare simple meals, which take around 15-20 minutes to complete. My typical posture is sitting or lying down due to fatigue. The perceived effort level for these baseline activities ranges from 2-4/10.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I try to engage in reading and watching movies as a way to relax and manage my symptoms. However, I often experience challenges with focus and concentration due to brain fog. I have not been able to maintain a consistent exercise routine but am trying to incorporate gentle stretches into my daily activities.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
My overall energy levels are low, and I try to pace myself throughout the day to avoid exacerbating my symptoms. I attempt to manage my activity level by taking regular breaks and engaging in restorative activities like meditation and deep breathing exercises.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I prefer a conversational interaction style with LogChat but may need assistance remembering specific details about my symptoms and activities due to cognitive impairments. Interacting with LogChat can be tiring for me, so I appreciate concise messages that help me stay on track without feeling overwhelmed.

Note: The updated profile reflects the most recent information from the last two interactions, prioritizing recovery and managing symptoms while considering the effects of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN).
