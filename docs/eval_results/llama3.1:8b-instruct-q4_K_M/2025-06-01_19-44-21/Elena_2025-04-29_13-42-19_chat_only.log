Given that your activity levels were significantly higher on April 22nd compared to the rest of the period, did you notice any notable differences in your symptoms or daily activities during this time?
2025-04-29 13:46:12 - Elena: Well, yesterday my husband asked for help with some paperwork, and for the first time, I said no without feeling awful about it. I remembered what that activity score looked like from the 21st, and I knew I just couldn't. Thank you for helping me see that. It really made a difference.
