2025-04-30 14:18:47 - Sarah: No change yesterday. I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session.
2025-04-30 14:19:22 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, it seems that your activity levels have been quite low over the past few days, with an average daily score of 180.0 when you were actively doing things. Considering this and your new energy envelope, how does your current work session align with what you expected in terms of effort level and duration?
2025-04-30 14:19:22 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10.
2025-04-30 14:19:43 - LogChat: Based on your cognitive work session today, how would you rate the severity of your brain fog on a scale from 1-10?
2025-04-30 14:19:44 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now.
2025-04-30 14:20:07 - LogChat: Based on your cognitive work session today, how would you rate the severity of your brain fog on a scale from 1-10? Also, considering your planned effort level for this session was likely higher than what you actually experienced (5/10), can you tell me if there's anything that helped you manage your energy better during this task compared to what you had anticipated according to your new energy envelope?
