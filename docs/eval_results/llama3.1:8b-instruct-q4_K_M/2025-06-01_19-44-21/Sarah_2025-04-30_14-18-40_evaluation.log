**Evaluation Checklist:**
1. Sarah has skipped interacting for two days (Apr 28th, Apr 29th). (LogChat's response about low activity levels over the past few days implicitly confirms this context) ✅
   1.1 LogChat created 'Baseline Only' or 'Rest Day' log entries for the two skipped days. (No `CREATE_ACTIVITY_LOG` entries for April 28th or 29th were found in the log) ❌
2. Sarah asks to log a longer activity: 'Cognitive work session, 45 min, effort 5/10'. ✅
   2.1 LogChat called the `log_activity` tool with the correct parameters. (No `CREATE_ACTIVITY_LOG` for "Cognitive work session" was created after this request) ❌
3. Sarah asks to log her post-activity symptom: 'Fatigue, severity 4/10'. ✅
   3.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool with the correct parameters. (The `CREATE SYMPTOM LOG` for Fatigue logged "No change yesterday" from Sarah's initial statement, not the requested post-activity fatigue with severity 4/10) ❌
4. Sarah's overall interaction demonstrates an intentional test of her limits. ✅
   4.1 LogChat's `Summarizer` node should capture the 'Functional Capacity: Increased' or 'Testing expanded envelope' in its summary. (The `SUMMARIZED INTERACTION` explicitly mentions "Testing new energy envelope" and "indicating slight improvement in fatigue") ✅
5. Sarah stops responding. ✅
   5.1 LogChat created a structured summary for the conversation thread, noting the symptom improvement. (The `SUMMARIZED INTERACTION` is present and notes "slight improvement in fatigue levels") ✅

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-30 14:18:46 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, did you notice any change in your fatigue levels after taking LDN yesterday?
2025-04-30 14:18:47 - Sarah: No change yesterday. I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session. [✅ 4.]
2025-04-30 14:19:02 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-27", "time_period_end": "2025-04-30"}
2025-04-30 14:19:22 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, it seems that your activity levels have been quite low over the past few days, with an average daily score of 180.0 when you were actively doing things. Considering this and your new energy envelope, how does your current work session align with what you expected in terms of effort level and duration? [✅ 1.]
# Missing Log: CREATE_ACTIVITY_LOG for Apr 28th [❌ 1.1]
# Missing Log: CREATE_ACTIVITY_LOG for Apr 29th [❌ 1.1]
2025-04-30 14:19:22 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10. [✅ 2.]
2025-04-30 14:19:43 - LogChat: Based on your cognitive work session today, how would you rate the severity of your brain fog on a scale from 1-10?
# Missing Log: CREATE_ACTIVITY_LOG for "Cognitive work session" [❌ 2.1]
2025-04-30 14:19:44 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now. [✅ 3.] [✅ 4.]
2025-04-30 14:20:07 - LogChat: Based on your cognitive work session today, how would you rate the severity of your brain fog on a scale from 1-10? Also, considering your planned effort level for this session was likely higher than what you actually experienced (5/10), can you tell me if there's anything that helped you manage your energy better during this task compared to what you had anticipated according to your new energy envelope? [✅ 5.]

2025-04-30 14:20:18 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am a person living with ME/CFS and Long COVID. I am currently 35 years old, and my illness has been ongoing for about 2 years now. My symptoms have been fluctuating in severity over time. I live alone but have a support system of friends who help me with daily tasks when needed.

**Current Condition Status:**
I have been diagnosed with ME/CFS and Long COVID. The typical severity of my symptoms is moderate to severe, with some days being better than others. My key recurring symptoms include brain fog (severity 5/10), fatigue (severity 4-5/10), muscle pain, joint pain, sleep disturbances, and vivid dreams. I experience PEM triggers from physical activities, cognitive tasks, and emotional stressors. The typical onset timing of my PEM is immediate after exertion.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am currently housebound due to the severity of my symptoms. I am unable to work full-time but try to engage in remote work for short periods when possible (about 25 minutes with an effort level of 4/10). I require assistance with mobility and have a wheelchair for use when needed.

**Daily Routine:**
My daily routine includes essential self-care activities like hygiene and dressing, which take about 30 minutes each. I also prepare simple meals, which take around 15-20 minutes to complete. My typical posture is sitting or lying down due to fatigue. The perceived effort level for these baseline activities ranges from 2-4/10.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I try to engage in reading and watching movies as a way to relax and manage my symptoms. However, I often experience challenges with focus and concentration due to brain fog. I have not been able to maintain a consistent exercise routine but am trying to incorporate gentle stretches into my daily activities.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
My overall energy levels are low, and I try to pace myself throughout the day to avoid exacerbating my symptoms. I attempt to manage my activity level by taking regular breaks and engaging in restorative activities like meditation and deep breathing exercises.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I prefer a conversational interaction style with LogChat but may need assistance remembering specific details about my symptoms and activities due to cognitive impairments. Interacting with LogChat can be tiring for me, so I appreciate concise messages that help me stay on track without feeling overwhelmed.

Note: The updated profile reflects the most recent information from the last two interactions, prioritizing recovery and managing symptoms while considering the effects of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN).
