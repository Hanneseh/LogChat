2025-04-22 09:10:05 - LogChat: Hi there! I'm LogChat, your personal companion designed to help you keep track of your day. I understand that managing ME/CFS or Long COVID can be challenging, and I'm here to make things a little easier. Simply chat with me about your day, and I'll log your symptoms and activities as we go. If you mention routines regularly, you can refer to them later for quick logging. By also sharing the effort an activity takes or the severity of a symptom, I can provide you with helpful activity scores and symptom reports down the line. To get started and personalize our conversations, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routines and functional capacity on an average day?
2025-04-22 09:10:06 - Sarah: I'm starting to use this app to track a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone, to see if it provides objective improvement. On a typical day, I do about 30 minutes of total upright activity for self-care and a simple meal, kept at an effort level of 3/10.
2025-04-22 09:10:29 - LogChat: Based on Sarah's mention of trying Low-Dose Naltrexone as a treatment, I'd like to ask: On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the intensity/severity of any symptoms you've experienced since starting this new treatment? Also, could you give me an estimate of the duration for your daily upright activities and meals, which seem to be around 30 minutes at an effort level of 3/10?
