2025-04-26 16:09:31 - Elena: Hi LogChat. I'm feeling a bit more stable today, thank you for asking. I've been thinking about what you said. I want to try to look at this differently.
2025-04-26 16:09:41 - LogChat: It's great to hear you're feeling more stable today and are open to looking at things differently. Your activity score was 0.0 yesterday, April 25th, which aligns with your rest. On April 21st, your score was 510.0, and on April 22nd it was 60.0. Does seeing these numbers help you reflect on how your activity levels might relate to feeling more stable today?
2025-04-26 16:09:42 - Elena: Wow. I didn't realize it added up like that. That score helps me see things more objectively. Can you review that day I crashed? Please tell me what my total calculated activity score was for April 21st.
2025-04-26 16:09:46 - LogChat: The activity score for April 21st was 510.0, as we discussed. Does seeing this specific number help you understand the impact of that day's activities, especially in relation to your crash?
