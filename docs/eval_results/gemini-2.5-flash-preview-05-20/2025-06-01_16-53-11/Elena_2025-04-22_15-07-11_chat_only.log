2025-04-22 15:07:15 - Elena: Hi LogChat, well, the crash hit as expected, and the PEM is just awful. I'm stuck in bed again.
2025-04-22 15:07:27 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear the PEM is so awful and you're stuck in bed. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your current fatigue, brain fog, and headache? Also, have you done any minimal activities today, and if so, what was their duration and effort?
2025-04-22 15:07:28 - Elena: My fatigue is a 10/10. Brain fog... ugh, my head is pounding, and I feel like I can't even think straight. The pain is an 8/10. I haven't done anything today, just lying here. It's just so unfair. I hate this feeling. I feel so useless, just a burden lying here in the dark.
2025-04-22 15:07:42 - LogChat: It's completely understandable to feel that way when you're dealing with such severe symptoms and feeling stuck. It sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening. Are you lying in the dark because of light sensitivity, and if so, how intense would you rate that on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-22 15:07:42 - Elena: Yes, I am extremely sensitive to light, maybe an 8/10. It makes the headache even worse.
2025-04-22 15:07:54 - LogChat: It makes perfect sense that extreme light sensitivity at an 8/10 would make your headache even worse. Are you also experiencing sensitivity to sounds or smells, and if so, how would you rate their intensity on a scale of 1 to 10?
