2025-04-27 10:02:48 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, we haven't talked for a couple of days. How have you been?
2025-04-27 10:02:48 - Sarah: I think the LDN might be having a positive effect. My brain fog feels less severe today.
2025-04-27 10:02:52 - LogChat: That's great news, Sarah! It's wonderful to hear the LDN might be helping. On a scale of 1 to 10, what would you rate your brain fog's intensity now, compared to your usual 5/10? Also, when did you take your LDN dose today?
2025-04-27 10:02:53 - Sarah: Please log symptom: Brain fog, severity: 3/10. That's a two-point improvement. I took the LDN at 9:00 AM.
2025-04-27 10:02:58 - LogChat: That's a significant improvement, Sarah, it's great to hear! Could you tell me about your morning routine today? What activities have you done since you woke up, and what felt like the effort level for each, from 1 to 10?
2025-04-27 10:02:58 - Sarah: I also read a technical article for 15 minutes. Note the effort was only a 4/10, which is lower than it would have been before.
2025-04-27 10:03:01 - LogChat: That's excellent, Sarah! It sounds like a positive change. Did you do any other activities this morning, besides reading the technical article and taking your LDN?
2025-04-27 10:03:02 - Sarah: No, that's all. Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-27 10:03:05 - LogChat: Understood, Sarah. Thanks for sharing, and rest well.
