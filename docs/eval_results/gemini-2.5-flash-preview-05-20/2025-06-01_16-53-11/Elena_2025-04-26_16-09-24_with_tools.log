2025-04-26 16:09:52 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I live with my husband, who assists me with daily tasks like going to the bathroom. I also have a son whom I try to help with homework.

**Current Condition Status:**
I am experiencing symptoms highly consistent with ME/CFS or Long COVID. I recently went through a severe PEM crash, feeling "drained" and "hit by a truck," which peaked around April 22nd with fatigue at 10/10, a pounding headache at 8/10, severe brain fog, and light sensitivity at 8/10. My PEM is triggered by cognitive and stressful exertion, with symptoms typically worsening throughout the evening after these activities. The crash started to lessen by April 24th, with fatigue at 8/10, and as of today, April 26th, I am feeling "a bit more stable." I understand that I experience PEM and that I did "too much" recently, leading to this crash.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am very limited in my activities and appear to be housebound. During the recent severe crash, I was stuck in bed and required assistance from my husband for basic activities like going to the bathroom. I also had difficulty with other basic activities like eating, and recently I had little energy or appetite to eat much. While I am feeling a bit more stable today, my functional capacity remains very low, primarily focused on essential self-care.

**Daily Routine:**
My established daily routine includes essential self-care like going to the bathroom, which takes about 10 minutes and feels like a 6/10 effort, requiring assistance from my husband. I also attempt to eat, which usually takes about 20 minutes and feels like a 3/10 effort, though I've eaten little recently due to lack of energy/appetite. For the past few days, I have had no activities beyond baseline self-care and have mostly been just lying in bed to rest.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
When not in a severe crash, I attempt to help my son with his homework, sitting on my bed, which takes about 30 minutes and is a 7/10 mental effort. I also had a stressful 15-minute phone call with the school recently, which was a 7+/10 effort and contributed to my recent crash. Currently, I have not attempted any activities and am just lying in bed, prioritizing rest.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
I tend to overexert myself, leading to severe PEM crashes, as I experienced recently. I acknowledge that I did "too much," resulting in severe symptoms and being stuck in bed. I feel frustrated, useless, and like a burden due to my condition. I also feel guilty for resting and struggle to accept it, despite knowing its importance for preventing worsening symptoms. However, I am now open to "looking at things differently" and found the activity scores helpful for objective reflection on my exertion levels.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
As this is my first few interactions, I am able to provide specific details about my symptoms with intensity ratings and activities with duration and effort levels. However, given my current severe fatigue and difficulty with basic activities, especially being in a severe crash, I prefer short and concise messages to avoid overwhelm. I am also feeling frustrated and burdened, which may come through in my messages. I even skipped logging one day to prioritize rest. I am interested in using LogChat to review my activity scores for objective reflection and am open to looking at my condition management differently.
