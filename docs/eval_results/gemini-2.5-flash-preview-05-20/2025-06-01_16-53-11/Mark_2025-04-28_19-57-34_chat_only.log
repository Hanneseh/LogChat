2025-04-28 19:57:39 - LogChat: Hi Mark, it's been a few days. How have things been since you were feeling brighter?
2025-04-28 19:57:40 - Mark: Hi LogChat. I skipped logging for the last two days, mostly resting. I actually felt okay after that video call on Friday, no major crash, so the rest seemed to help. But today I'm feeling the payback.
2025-04-28 19:57:46 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear you're feeling the payback today, Mark. That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what symptoms you're experiencing right now and how intense they are on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-28 19:57:46 - Mark: I've got high fatigue and trouble concentrating. Plus, I feel dizzy when I stand up.
2025-04-28 19:57:49 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing, Mark. To help me understand better, could you rate the intensity of your fatigue, trouble concentrating, and dizziness on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is mild and 10 is severe?
2025-04-28 19:57:50 - Mark: Fatigue is maybe an 8. Concentration is a 7. Dizziness... maybe a 6.
2025-04-28 19:57:55 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing those ratings, Mark. I'm sorry you're dealing with those symptoms today. Could you tell me what you've been doing today, and for how long? Also, how much effort (1-10) did those activities take?
2025-04-28 19:57:55 - Mark: Today, not much. Mostly lying down. Yesterday, I did go for a short walk outside. Maybe 10 minutes. It felt like low effort at the time, maybe a 3.
2025-04-28 19:58:00 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing about your walk yesterday, Mark. So, a 10-minute walk with an effort of 3. And for today, how long have you been mostly lying down, and what would you rate the effort of that on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-28 19:58:01 - Mark: I've been lying down most of the day. Effort is low, maybe a 2. I read on a forum about people using heart rate monitors... Can you tell me more about that?
2025-04-28 19:58:08 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, heart rate monitors can be helpful aids for pacing in ME/CFS by monitoring a rise in pulse rate. Pacing itself is about balancing activity and rest to help avoid post-exertional malaise. About how long have you been lying down today?
2025-04-28 19:58:09 - Mark: All day, pretty much.
2025-04-28 19:58:21 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, heart rate monitors can be helpful aids for pacing in ME/CFS by monitoring a rise in pulse rate. Pacing itself is about balancing activity and rest to help avoid post-exertional malaise. Since you've been interested in learning how to pace correctly, would you like me to tell you more about the principles of pacing?
2025-04-28 19:58:22 - Mark: Sure, go ahead.
2025-04-28 19:58:30 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, pacing in ME/CFS is about balancing activity and rest to manage your energy, stabilize your illness, and control symptoms. It involves learning your limitations and can take some trial and error to master. Do you have any specific questions about how to apply these principles to your daily life?
