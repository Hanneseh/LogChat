2025-04-25 15:56:15 - Mark: I'm a bit brighter today. Brain fog is mild. How do I actually know if I'm pacing correctly? What should I be looking for?
2025-04-25 15:56:24 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, knowing if you're pacing correctly often comes down to listening to your body. The goal of pacing is to gain better control and stabilization of your illness, leading to a more stable daily situation and improved symptom control, though it's also a learning process that involves some trial and error. Since your brain fog is mild today, what activities have you managed to do so far, and how would you rate the effort for them on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-25 15:56:25 - Mark: Fatigue is much better today, maybe a 4/10. I had a 15-minute video call with my sister. I'd say that was moderate emotional and cognitive effort. I'm resting now to see what happens.
2025-04-25 15:56:38 - LogChat: It's good that you're resting to see what happens, that's definitely a key part of listening to your body when pacing. You mentioned the video call was moderate effort; on a scale of 1 to 10, what number would best describe that effort?
2025-04-25 15:56:38 - Mark: Maybe a 6/10? I'm trying to be more aware of emotional and cognitive effort.
2025-04-25 15:56:53 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing that effort rating. Knowing if pacing is working involves carefully listening to your body and observing if activities, like the video call, lead to Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM). If PEM occurs, it's a sign to decrease activity, and if no PEM occurs, you might gradually increase. If activity management remains difficult, it's a good idea to discuss it with your GP. How are you feeling now after resting, and did any new symptoms or increased fatigue develop after the video call?
2025-04-25 15:56:54 - Mark: I also paid a couple of bills online. Took about 15 active minutes, low-to-moderate effort.
2025-04-25 15:56:58 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing that you paid a couple of bills online for about 15 minutes with low-to-moderate effort. On a scale of 1 to 10, what number would best describe the effort for that activity?
2025-04-25 15:56:59 - Mark: Say 4/10. Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-25 15:57:02 - LogChat: Understood, Mark. Thanks for sharing your activities and effort ratings for today. Rest well, and I'm here when you're ready to log again.
