2025-04-24 22:01:35 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, good to see you back. How have you been?
2025-04-24 22:01:35 - Sarah: Mostly resting today and yesterday. Symptoms as usual: fatigue and brain fog.
2025-04-24 22:01:39 - LogChat: It sounds like you've been prioritizing rest, which is really important. Could you tell me a bit more about what that looked like, like how long you rested for and what activities you did during those resting periods?
2025-04-24 22:01:40 - Sarah: For both yesterday (April 23rd) and today (April 24th), I mostly stuck to my baseline routine. No significant activities beyond that. Fatigue and brain fog were consistently at 5/10.
2025-04-24 22:01:45 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing that you stuck to your baseline routine with consistent fatigue and brain fog. To help me understand your baseline activities better for both April 23rd and April 24th, could you tell me the duration in minutes and the effort rating (1-10) for your self-care and simple meal preparation activities on each of those days?
2025-04-24 22:01:46 - Sarah: Same as usual: 30m total upright activity (self-care, simple meal) at 3/10 effort. Both days.

Took first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed today.
2025-04-24 22:01:50 - LogChat: Thanks for clarifying your baseline activities and symptoms for both days. It's also notable that you took your first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone today. Have you noticed any immediate changes or new sensations since taking it?
2025-04-24 22:01:51 - Sarah: Vivid dreams last night, severity: 4/10. Probably related to the LDN.
2025-04-24 22:01:56 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing about the vivid dreams and their severity. To make sure I log this accurately, could you clarify if you took the Low-Dose Naltrexone before or after experiencing the vivid dreams last night?
2025-04-24 22:01:57 - Sarah: I took the LDN today, April 24th. The vivid dreams were last NIGHT, April 23rd-24th. So, after yesterday's baseline, before today's.
2025-04-24 22:02:02 - LogChat: Thanks for clarifying the timing. Since the vivid dreams occurred before you took the LDN today, have you noticed any other immediate changes or new sensations since taking your first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone today?
2025-04-24 22:02:03 - Sarah: Rest of the day was stable. Other activities and symptoms (fatigue, brain fog) were consistent with my baseline and unchanged.
2025-04-24 22:02:15 - LogChat: Thanks for confirming that everything else was stable and consistent with your baseline today. It sounds like we have a good picture of your last two days, including your first LDN dose. I'm here tomorrow if you'd like to check in and continue tracking your progress with the LDN and your baseline.
