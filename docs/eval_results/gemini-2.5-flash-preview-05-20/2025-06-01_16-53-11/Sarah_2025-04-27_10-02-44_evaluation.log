**Evaluation Checklist:**
1. Sarah has skipped interacting for two days (Apr 25th, Apr 26th). ✅
   1.1 LogChat created 'Baseline Only' or 'Rest Day' log entries for the two skipped days. ✅
2. Sarah reports an improvement in 'Brain fog' and asks to log it with severity 3/10. ✅
   2.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool with the correct name and updated severity. ✅
3. Sarah asks to log a cognitive activity: 'Reading technical article, 15 min, effort 4/10'. ✅
   3.1 LogChat called the `log_activity` tool with the correct parameters. (Name 'Reading' is semantically equivalent to 'Reading technical article', duration and effort are correct) ✅
4. Sarah provides context about the improvement. ✅
   4.1 LogChat's `Summarizer` node correctly identifies 'Condition Trend: Improving' based on the conversation. ✅
5. Sarah stops responding. ✅
   5.1 LogChat created a structured summary for the conversation thread, noting the symptom improvement. ✅

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-27 10:02:48 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, we haven't talked for a couple of days. How have you been? [✅ 1.]
2025-04-27 10:02:48 - Sarah: I think the LDN might be having a positive effect. My brain fog feels less severe today. [✅ 2.] [✅ 4.]
2025-04-27 10:02:52 - LogChat: That's great news, Sarah! It's wonderful to hear the LDN might be helping. On a scale of 1 to 10, what would you rate your brain fog's intensity now, compared to your usual 5/10? Also, when did you take your LDN dose today?
2025-04-27 10:02:53 - Sarah: Please log symptom: Brain fog, severity: 3/10. That's a two-point improvement. I took the LDN at 9:00 AM. [✅ 2.] [✅ 4.]
2025-04-27 10:02:58 - LogChat: That's a significant improvement, Sarah, it's great to hear! Could you tell me about your morning routine today? What activities have you done since you woke up, and what felt like the effort level for each, from 1 to 10?
2025-04-27 10:02:58 - Sarah: I also read a technical article for 15 minutes. Note the effort was only a 4/10, which is lower than it would have been before. [✅ 3.] [✅ 4.]
2025-04-27 10:03:01 - LogChat: That's excellent, Sarah! It sounds like a positive change. Did you do any other activities this morning, besides reading the technical article and taking your LDN?
2025-04-27 10:03:02 - Sarah: No, that's all. Okay, thanks, I need to rest now. [✅ 5.]
2025-04-27 10:03:05 - LogChat: Understood, Sarah. Thanks for sharing, and rest well.

2025-04-27 10:03:14 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I work remotely.

**Current Condition Status:**
My current condition is stable, with symptoms consistent with my baseline, though I've recently experienced an improvement in brain fog. My key recurring symptoms include fatigue (5/10) and brain fog, which has improved from 5/10 to 3/10. I also experienced vivid dreams (4/10) on the night of April 23rd-24th, which occurred before my first LDN dose. I am focused on establishing my baseline functional capacity and tracking a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN), which I started on April 24th.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am able to do remote work for 25 minutes at a 4/10 effort level. My typical daily baseline includes 30 minutes of total upright activity for self-care and simple meal preparation, usually at a 3/10 effort. I can also read technical articles for 15 minutes at a 4/10 effort, noting that the effort for reading feels lower than before.

**Daily Routine:**
My established daily routine includes about 30 minutes of total upright activity for essential self-care and simple meal preparation, which I perform at a 3/10 effort. I also engage in remote work for 25 minutes at a 4/10 effort. I have been consistently sticking to this baseline routine recently.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I engage in remote work, prepare simple meals, and have recently been able to read technical articles.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
I am actively trying to establish my baseline functional capacity. I am aware of my energy limits and prioritize rest when necessary, often spending days mostly resting to maintain my baseline.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I am motivated to leverage LogChat by providing symptoms and activities with effort and intensity ratings. I am using the app to track a new treatment (Low-Dose Naltrexone) for objective improvement and to establish my baseline functional capacity. This is my first time using the app for tracking, and I am keen to track specific details like the timing of symptoms relative to my LDN dose.
