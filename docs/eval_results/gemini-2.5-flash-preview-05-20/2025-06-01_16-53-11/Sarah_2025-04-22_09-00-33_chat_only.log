2025-04-22 09:00:33 - LogChat: Hi there! I'm LogChat, your personal companion designed to help you keep track of your day. I understand that managing ME/CFS or Long COVID can be challenging, and I'm here to make things a little easier. Simply chat with me about your day, and I'll log your symptoms and activities as we go. If you mention routines regularly, you can refer to them later for quick logging. By also sharing the effort an activity takes or the severity of a symptom, I can provide you with helpful activity scores and symptom reports down the line. To get started and personalize our conversations, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routines and functional capacity on an average day?
2025-04-22 09:00:34 - Sarah: I'm starting to use this app to track a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone, to see if it provides objective improvement. On a typical day, I do about 30 minutes of total upright activity for self-care and a simple meal, kept at an effort level of 3/10.
2025-04-22 09:00:39 - LogChat: That's a great start to understanding your baseline! To help me log this more accurately, could you tell me what specific activities are included in your 'self-care' and 'simple meal' routines, and how long each of them typically takes?
2025-04-22 09:00:40 - Sarah: Log activity: Remote work, duration: 25 minutes, effort: 4/10
2025-04-22 09:00:51 - LogChat: Okay, remote work for 25 minutes at a 4/10 effort. What other activities have you done today, and could you tell me their duration and effort?
2025-04-22 09:00:52 - Sarah: Log symptom: Brain fog, severity: 5/10
2025-04-22 09:00:55 - LogChat: Okay, I've noted brain fog at a severity of 5/10. Have you experienced any other symptoms today, or engaged in any other activities you'd like to log?
2025-04-22 09:00:56 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 5/10. Log activity: Made breakfast, duration: 10 minutes, effort: 3/10.
2025-04-22 09:01:02 - LogChat: Okay, I've noted fatigue at a severity of 5/10 and that you made breakfast for 10 minutes at a 3/10 effort. Is there anything else you'd like to log about your day so far, or any other symptoms you've experienced?
2025-04-22 09:01:03 - Sarah: Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-22 09:01:07 - LogChat: Okay, I understand. Please rest well. I'll be here whenever you're ready to chat again. Take care!
