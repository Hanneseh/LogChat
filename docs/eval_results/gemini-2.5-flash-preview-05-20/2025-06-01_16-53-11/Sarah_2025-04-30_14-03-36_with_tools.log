2025-04-30 14:03:39 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, we haven't talked for a few days. How have you been?
2025-04-30 14:03:40 - Sarah: I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session.
2025-04-30 14:03:43 - LogChat: That sounds like a proactive approach to managing your energy! To log your work session, could you tell me how long it lasted and what effort level (1-10) it required?
2025-04-30 14:03:43 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10.
2025-04-30 14:03:47 - LogChat: Thanks for logging your cognitive work session. Since you're testing your new energy envelope, how are you feeling after it? Did you notice any changes in your fatigue or brain fog?
2025-04-30 14:03:48 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now.
2025-04-30 14:03:51 - LogChat: Okay Sarah, thanks for sharing about your fatigue. Take care, and I'm here when you're ready to log again.

2025-04-30 14:03:56 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I work remotely.

**Current Condition Status:**
My current condition is stable, and I am testing a new energy envelope. My key recurring symptoms include fatigue, which is currently 4/10 (less than expected), and brain fog, which has improved from 5/10 to 3/10. I also experienced vivid dreams (4/10) on the night of April 23rd-24th, which occurred before my first LDN dose. I am focused on establishing my baseline functional capacity and tracking a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN), which I started on April 24th.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am able to do remote work, having recently attempted a cognitive work session for 45 minutes at a 5/10 effort. My typical daily baseline includes 30 minutes of total upright activity for self-care and simple meal preparation, usually at a 3/10 effort. I can also read technical articles for 15 minutes at a 4/10 effort, noting that the effort for reading feels lower than before.

**Daily Routine:**
My established daily routine includes about 30 minutes of total upright activity for essential self-care and simple meal preparation, which I perform at a 3/10 effort. I also engage in remote work for 25 minutes at a 4/10 effort. I have been consistently sticking to this baseline routine recently.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I engage in remote work, prepare simple meals, and have recently been able to read technical articles. I am also attempting longer cognitive work sessions.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
I am actively trying to establish and test a new energy envelope for my baseline functional capacity. I am aware of my energy limits and prioritize rest when necessary, often spending days mostly resting to maintain my baseline.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I am motivated to leverage LogChat by providing symptoms and activities with effort and intensity ratings. I am using the app to track a new treatment (Low-Dose Naltrexone) for objective improvement and to establish my baseline functional capacity. This is my first time using the app for tracking, and I am keen to track specific details like the timing of symptoms relative to my LDN dose.
