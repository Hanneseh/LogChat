2025-04-30 14:03:43 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10.
2025-04-30 14:03:47 - LogChat: Thanks for logging your cognitive work session. Since you're testing your new energy envelope, how are you feeling after it? Did you notice any changes in your fatigue or brain fog?
2025-04-30 14:03:48 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now.
2025-04-30 14:03:51 - LogChat: Okay Sarah, thanks for sharing about your fatigue. Take care, and I'm here when you're ready to log again.
