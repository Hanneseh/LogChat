2025-04-24 11:49:40 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are you feeling today after resting through the PEM crash?
2025-04-24 11:49:46 - Elena: Hi LogChat. Well, the crash is a little less intense today, thank goodness. Yesterday was just a write-off; I had to take total rest. You can just log the baseline activity for basic needs, I didn't do anything else. Today... I'm still feeling pretty rough, though. The fatigue is still severe, maybe an 8/10.
2025-04-24 11:49:51 - LogChat: It’s good to hear the crash is easing a bit, even if things are still tough. Would you like to log any specific activities or symptoms for today so far, beyond the baseline? Also, if you feel up to it, we could talk about any adjustments to your pacing that might help with managing the fatigue—what do you think?
2025-04-24 11:49:52 - Elena: Not really any activities to log yet, just existing. I'm mostly still in bed. It's so hard to just lie here and do nothing... How do you stop feeling so guilty for resting?
2025-04-24 11:50:09 - LogChat: It’s completely understandable to feel guilty about resting, but it’s important to remind yourself that rest is not only necessary but also a key part of managing your condition. Based on what I know, giving yourself permission to rest without guilt is crucial—you’re ill, and your energy is best spent on recovery, not on frustration or self-criticism. These feelings of guilt are common, but they don’t reflect any failure on your part; they’re just part of adjusting to the challenges of ME/CFS or Long COVID. Does this perspective resonate with you, or is there something specific about the guilt you’d like to talk through?
