2025-04-25 15:37:40 - LogChat: Hi Mark, how are you feeling today after taking a baseline day to rest yesterday?
2025-04-25 15:37:41 - Mark: I'm feeling a bit brighter today, actually. The brain fog is only mild.
2025-04-25 15:37:51 - LogChat: That's good to hear, Mark. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your fatigue and muscle ache today? Have you done any activities so far? If so, could you share how long they lasted and how much effort they felt like, also on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-25 15:37:52 - Mark: Fatigue is much better, only a 4/10. I had a 15-minute video call with my sister. I'd rate that as moderate emotional and cognitive effort. I'm resting now after the call to see what happens. Trying to be more aware of emotional and cognitive effort, like we talked about.
2025-04-25 15:38:03 - LogChat: It’s great that you’re being mindful of emotional and cognitive effort, Mark. For the video call, how would you rate the emotional effort and cognitive effort separately on a scale of 1 to 10? Have you noticed any immediate changes in your symptoms after the call, and do you have a specific rest duration in mind before your next activity?
2025-04-25 15:38:04 - Mark: I'd say the emotional effort was a 5 and the cognitive effort a 6. No immediate changes, but I know PEM can be delayed. I don't have a set rest duration, just taking it easy for a while. I also paid a couple of bills online. That took about 15 active minutes, low-to-moderate effort.
2025-04-25 15:38:15 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing, Mark. For paying the bills online, how would you rate the effort on a scale of 1 to 10? Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since finishing that task? And do you think you'll rest a bit longer before starting anything else?
2025-04-25 15:38:16 - Mark: I'd rate the bill paying as a 4 for effort. No changes yet. Yes, definitely resting longer. How do I actually know if I'm pacing correctly? What should I be looking for?
2025-04-25 15:38:34 - LogChat: Pacing is about finding a balance between activity and rest to avoid triggering PEM. It involves being mindful of physical, mental, and emotional effort, like you're already doing, and adjusting your activities based on how your body responds. Tracking activities, effort ratings, and symptoms can help you spot patterns and identify a sustainable activity level. Over time, this can guide you to rest before symptoms worsen. Would you like help setting up a simple system to track this and support your pacing efforts?
