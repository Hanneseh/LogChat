2025-04-27 10:44:15 - Sarah: I think the LDN might be having a positive effect. My brain fog feels less severe today. Please log symptom: Brain fog, severity: 3/10. That's a two-point improvement. I also read a technical article for 15 minutes. Note the effort was only a 4/10, which is lower than it would have been before.
2025-04-27 10:44:25 - LogChat: It’s great to hear that your brain fog has improved and that reading felt less effortful—those sound like encouraging signs! Have you noticed any other changes in your symptoms or energy levels since starting the Low-Dose Naltrexone? Also, would you like to log any other activities or symptoms from today?
2025-04-27 10:44:26 - Sarah: No other changes to report. That's all for now.
2025-04-27 10:44:36 - LogChat: It’s wonderful to hear about the improvement in your brain fog—it sounds like a step in the right direction! Since you’ve mentioned vivid dreams in the past, would you like to continue tracking those as a recurring symptom? Or, with the improvement in brain fog, are there any specific goals or activities you’re hoping to work toward?
