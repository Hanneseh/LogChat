2025-04-28 19:39:02 - LogChat: Hi Mark, good to see you back—how are you feeling after taking a couple of rest days?
2025-04-28 19:39:04 - Mark: Hi LogChat. I did skip the last two days, yes, mostly resting. I'm feeling the payback from a short walk I took yesterday. Fatigue is high, and I'm having trouble concentrating today. Also feel dizzy when I stand up.
2025-04-28 19:39:14 - LogChat: It sounds like the walk might have pushed your limits a bit. How long was the walk, and how much effort did it feel like on a scale of 1 to 10? Also, when you stand up, how long does the dizziness last, and how severe would you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-28 19:39:15 - Mark: The walk was only 10 minutes, and felt like a 3/10 effort at the time. The dizziness lasts maybe a minute when I stand up, and I'd rate it a 6/10.
2025-04-28 19:39:26 - LogChat: Have you experienced dizziness when standing up before, or is this a new symptom for you? Also, have you noticed any patterns or triggers, like certain times of day or specific activities, that seem to bring it on?
2025-04-28 19:39:27 - Mark: I've had the dizziness before. It's part of the orthostatic intolerance I get with ME/CFS. Seems worse when I'm tired.
2025-04-28 19:39:38 - LogChat: It sounds like you're already familiar with managing orthostatic intolerance. Have you tried strategies like increasing salt intake, wearing compression garments, or elevating your legs while resting? If so, have you noticed any improvement or worsening of the dizziness with these approaches?
2025-04-28 19:39:40 - Mark: I haven't tried compression garments. I do try to drink enough water and add salt. It helps a bit.

I wanted to mention that I actually felt okay after that video call with my sister on Friday. No major crash, so the rest I took beforehand must have helped.
2025-04-28 19:39:52 - LogChat: It’s great to hear that the rest before your video call seemed to make a difference—it sounds like a thoughtful pacing strategy paid off. Would you like to explore how pre-activity rest might help with managing other activities? Also, have you considered tracking your hydration and salt intake to see if they correlate with any changes in your orthostatic intolerance symptoms?
2025-04-28 19:39:53 - Mark: Not right now, thanks. I was reading on a forum about people using heart rate monitors for pacing. Can you tell me more about that?
2025-04-28 19:40:14 - LogChat: Using a heart rate monitor for pacing can be a helpful tool for managing ME/CFS. It works by helping you stay within your "energy envelope" by monitoring your heart rate and ensuring it doesn’t exceed a threshold that might trigger post-exertional malaise (PEM). This threshold is often calculated as 50-60% of your maximum heart rate (220 minus your age). By staying below this limit during activities, you can reduce the risk of overexertion. Would you like guidance on how to calculate your threshold or tips on using a heart rate monitor effectively?
2025-04-28 19:40:16 - Mark: That's helpful, thanks. Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-28 19:40:26 - LogChat: Got it, Mark. Rest well, and remember, I’m here whenever you’re ready to continue. Take care!
