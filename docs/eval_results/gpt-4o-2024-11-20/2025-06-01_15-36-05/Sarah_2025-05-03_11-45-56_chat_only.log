2025-05-03 11:46:02 - Sarah: I've been stable. I'd like to use the data to verify my perceived improvements. I need you to retrieve some activity scores.
2025-05-03 11:46:17 - LogChat: I couldn’t find any activity logs for the period from May 26 to June 1, 2025. Would you like to specify a different time range or clarify the dates you’re interested in?
2025-05-03 11:46:18 - Sarah: Sorry, typo. Can you retrieve my calculated activity score for April 22nd? That was a baseline day before I started the medication.
2025-05-03 11:46:33 - LogChat: Your activity score for April 22nd, a baseline day before starting Low-Dose Naltrexone, was 90.0. Does this match how you remember your activity and energy levels on that day? Would you like me to compare this with scores from days after starting the medication?
2025-05-03 11:46:35 - Sarah: Now, can you retrieve the activity score for April 30th, the day I did the longer work session?
2025-05-03 11:46:51 - LogChat: Your activity score for April 30th, the day of the longer work session, was 285.0. This is a significant increase compared to your baseline score of 90.0 from April 22nd. Does this difference align with how you felt on those days? Would you like to discuss what might have contributed to this change?
2025-05-03 11:46:52 - Sarah: Perfect. Please show me the comparison of those two scores.
2025-05-03 11:47:09 - LogChat: The activity score for April 22nd was 90.0, while for April 30th, it was 285.0—a significant increase. This suggests a notable rise in activity level on April 30th compared to your baseline day. Does this reflect your perceived improvement in energy or capacity since starting Low-Dose Naltrexone? Were there any specific factors or strategies you think contributed to the higher score on April 30th?
