2025-04-22 15:48:33 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are you feeling today after the extra activities yesterday?
2025-04-22 15:48:34 - Elena: Hi LogChat. Well, as expected, the crash hit. The PEM is just awful.
2025-04-22 15:48:44 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear the PEM has hit hard, Elena. Could you share more about your current symptoms? What are you experiencing, how intense are they on a scale of 1 to 10, and how long have they been persisting since the crash began?
2025-04-22 15:48:46 - Elena: Everything is just... amplified. The fatigue is a 10/10, I can barely lift my head. And the pain is an 8/10, it's everywhere. It's just so unfair. I hate this feeling. I feel so useless, just a burden lying here in the dark. My head is pounding and I feel like I can't even think straight.
2025-04-22 15:48:54 - LogChat: I'm so sorry you're feeling this way, Elena. It’s completely understandable to feel frustrated and overwhelmed when the symptoms are this intense. You’re not a burden—what you’re going through is incredibly tough, and it’s okay to need rest and care. Have you been able to do anything to ease the pain or fatigue, like resting, using aids, or taking any medication? If not, would you like to talk about some strategies that might help during this crash?
2025-04-22 15:48:56 - Elena: Not really. I'm just lying here in the dark. I'm also really sensitive to light, maybe an 8/10.
2025-04-22 15:49:05 - LogChat: It sounds like the light sensitivity is adding to how tough this crash feels, Elena. Has this been a symptom during previous crashes, or does it feel new this time? If you'd like, we can log it and explore some strategies to manage it in the future.
2025-04-22 15:49:07 - Elena: It's pretty normal during a crash.
2025-04-22 15:49:16 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing that, Elena. Since the light sensitivity is a recurring symptom during crashes, would you like to log it as part of your current experience? Have you noticed any specific triggers or patterns that seem to make it worse, like certain types of light or screen use?
