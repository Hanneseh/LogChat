2025-04-22 09:42:36 - LogChat: Hi there! I'm LogChat, your personal companion designed to help you keep track of your day. I understand that managing ME/CFS or Long COVID can be challenging, and I'm here to make things a little easier. Simply chat with me about your day, and I'll log your symptoms and activities as we go. If you mention routines regularly, you can refer to them later for quick logging. By also sharing the effort an activity takes or the severity of a symptom, I can provide you with helpful activity scores and symptom reports down the line. To get started and personalize our conversations, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routines and functional capacity on an average day?
2025-04-22 09:42:37 - Sarah: I'm starting to use this app to track a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone, to see if it provides objective improvement. On a typical day, I do about 30 minutes of total upright activity for self-care and a simple meal, kept at an effort level of 3/10.
2025-04-22 09:42:45 - LogChat: When did you start taking Low-Dose Naltrexone? Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms or energy levels since beginning the treatment?
2025-04-22 09:42:46 - Sarah: I started it yesterday. Too soon to tell.
2025-04-22 09:42:55 - LogChat: Would you like to log your baseline activities—30 minutes of upright activity for self-care and a simple meal at 3/10 effort—for yesterday and today? Also, did you notice any specific symptoms or changes during or after these activities, even if subtle?
