2025-04-26 16:50:33 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are you feeling today after taking some extra rest yesterday?
2025-04-26 16:50:34 - Elena: Hi LogChat. I've been thinking about what you said. I want to try to look at this differently. I feel a bit more stable today, thank goodness. Still not great, but a little better than the last few days.
2025-04-26 16:50:45 - LogChat: I'm glad to hear you're feeling a bit more stable today, Elena. Could you share which symptoms you're experiencing right now and rate their intensity on a scale of 1 to 10? Also, did you manage to do any activities today? If so, how much effort did they take (1-10), and about how long did you spend on them?
2025-04-26 16:50:47 - Elena: Well, the fatigue is still hanging around, maybe a 6 or 7. And my head is a bit foggy, maybe a 5? I haven't done much today, just the usual getting up and moving around the house. I did try to make myself some breakfast, but that was about it.
2025-04-26 16:50:57 - LogChat: Itâ€™s good that you managed to make yourself breakfast, Elena. How long did it take you to prepare it, and how much effort would you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10? Also, while moving around the house today, did you notice any symptoms like light sensitivity or pain?
2025-04-26 16:50:58 - Elena: Making breakfast... hmm, maybe 20 minutes? And the effort... maybe a 6? It's hard to say. As for moving around, yes, the light in the kitchen was bothering me, maybe a 4 for light sensitivity. It's always worse in the kitchen. You know, I was wondering... Can you review that day I crashed? Please tell me what my total calculated activity score was for April 21st.
2025-04-26 16:51:15 - LogChat: Your total calculated activity score for April 21st was 450.0. Does this align with how you felt that day, especially considering the PEM crash that followed? Do you recall any specific activities that might have contributed most to this score?
