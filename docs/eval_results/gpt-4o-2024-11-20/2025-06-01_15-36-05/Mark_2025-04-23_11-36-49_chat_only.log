2025-04-23 11:36:50 - LogChat: Hi Mark, how are you feeling today after the crash from gardening?
2025-04-23 11:36:51 - Mark: Not great. I didn't log anything yesterday because I was completely wiped out. Just rested all day.

Today I'm still recovering. Muscle ache is moderate, but brain fog is severe. Overall fatigue is still quite high, maybe a 7/10.

Can we say that any day I don't interact should be assumed to be a 'baseline only' day?
2025-04-23 11:36:56 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing, Mark. We can definitely note that any day you don't interact should be assumed as a 'baseline only' day if that works best for you—just let me know if you'd like to log yesterday that way. For today, it sounds like you're still in recovery mode. Could you tell me how long you've been resting so far and if you've attempted any activities? If so, how would you rate the effort for those on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-23 11:36:57 - Mark: I tried to read an email from my disability insurance provider for about 5 minutes. It felt like a very high effort mentally and left me feeling completely overwhelmed.
2025-04-23 11:37:03 - LogChat: It sounds like reading that email took a lot out of you. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the mental effort it required? Also, could you share a bit more about how the brain fog is affecting you today—like specific challenges you're noticing? And just to confirm, would you like me to log yesterday as a 'baseline only' day?
2025-04-23 11:37:04 - Mark: I'd rate the mental effort a 9/10.

Can thinking or concentrating actually make you physically tired? Is that part of ME/CFS?

And yes, please log yesterday as baseline.
2025-04-23 11:37:11 - LogChat: Thanks, Mark. I've logged yesterday as a 'baseline only' day as you requested. To answer your question, yes, mental activities like thinking or concentrating can absolutely cause physical fatigue in ME/CFS. This happens because cognitive tasks demand significant energy, and with ME/CFS, energy production and use are impaired. This can lead to symptoms like brain fog and even physical exhaustion after mental exertion. Would you like to explore strategies to manage cognitive exertion and reduce its impact?
2025-04-23 11:37:12 - Mark: Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-23 11:37:15 - LogChat: Got it, Mark. Rest well and take care of yourself. I'm here whenever you're ready to check in again.
