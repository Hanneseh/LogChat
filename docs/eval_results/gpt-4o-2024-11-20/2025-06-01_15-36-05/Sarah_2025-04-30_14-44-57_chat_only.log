2025-04-30 14:45:01 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, good to see you back—how has your brain fog been since we last talked?
2025-04-30 14:45:02 - Sarah: Brain fog: 3/10. I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session.
2025-04-30 14:45:12 - LogChat: How long did your work session last, and what effort level would you rate it on a scale from 1 to 10? Did you notice any changes in your symptoms during or after the session?
2025-04-30 14:45:13 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10.
2025-04-30 14:45:23 - LogChat: Did you notice any changes in your symptoms, like increased fatigue or brain fog, after the 45-minute work session? Also, are you planning to test your energy envelope further today, and if so, what activities do you have in mind?
2025-04-30 14:45:24 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now. I'm done logging for the day and will end the interaction.
2025-04-30 14:45:35 - LogChat: Got it, Sarah. Thanks for sharing your logs and for updating me on your energy envelope test—it sounds like you're managing things thoughtfully. Rest well, and if you want to log more or chat about your progress, I’m here anytime. Take care!
