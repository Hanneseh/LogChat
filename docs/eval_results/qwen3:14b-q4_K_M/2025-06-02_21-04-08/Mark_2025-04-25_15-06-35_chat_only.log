2025-04-25 15:06:36 - LogChat: Hi Mark, did reading cause more fatigue than usual today?
2025-04-25 15:06:37 - Mark: Hi LogChat. No, I didn't do any reading today. Actually, I'm feeling a bit brighter today. The brain fog is only mild. Fatigue is much better too.
2025-04-25 15:06:44 - LogChat: That's great to hear, Mark — it's encouraging that you're feeling brighter and that the fatigue is improving. Did you do anything today that you'd like to log, including how long it took and how much effort it required on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-25 15:06:45 - Mark: Yes, I had a video call with my sister. It was about 15 minutes. I'd say it took moderate emotional and cognitive effort. I'm trying to be more aware of that kind of effort now. I'm resting after the call to see what happens. I also paid a couple of bills online. That took about 15 minutes too, and was low-to-moderate effort.
2025-04-25 15:06:52 - LogChat: That’s thoughtful of you to be paying attention to your effort levels, Mark — it’s a great step toward managing your energy more effectively. Could you rate the emotional and cognitive effort of the video call on a scale from 1 to 10, and did you notice any changes in your symptoms afterward, like increased fatigue or brain fog?
2025-04-25 15:06:53 - Mark: I'd rate the video call a 5 for emotional and cognitive effort. I'm resting now, so I haven't noticed any changes yet. My fatigue level right now is about a 4 out of 10. How do I actually know if I'm pacing correctly? What should I be looking for?
2025-04-25 15:07:00 - LogChat: That’s a thoughtful question, Mark — understanding your body’s signals is a key part of pacing. What specific signs or symptoms do you usually notice after an activity that might indicate you’ve pushed yourself too far, such as increased fatigue, brain fog, or a drop in energy later in the day?
