2025-04-27 10:14:55 - Sarah: I think the LDN might be having a positive effect. My brain fog feels less severe today. Please log symptom: Brain fog, severity: 3/10. That's a two-point improvement. I also read a technical article for 15 minutes. Note the effort was only a 4/10, which is lower than it would have been before.
