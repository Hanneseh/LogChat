2025-04-24 11:21:32 - LogChat: Hi Elena, did you experience a crash after our last conversation on the 22nd?
2025-04-24 11:21:34 - Elena: Oh, yes, definitely. That phone call really did me in. I ended up needing yesterday, the 23rd, for total rest. I didn't even log in. Just the bare minimum to take care of myself, you know? If you could just log the baseline activity for that day, that would be great. Today, the crash is a little less intense, thank goodness, but the fatigue is still pretty severe.
2025-04-24 11:21:41 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear about the crash, Elena — I hope you're feeling a little better today. Would you like to share any activities you did today, along with how long they lasted and how intense they felt on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-24 11:21:42 - Elena: Not much to report today. Mostly just lying here, trying to recover. The fatigue is still severe, maybe an 8 out of 10. It's so hard to just lie here and do nothing... How do you stop feeling so guilty for resting?
2025-04-24 11:21:48 - LogChat: It's completely valid to feel guilty, but rest is a crucial part of managing your condition — it's not a sign of weakness, but of self-care. Would you like to explore some strategies or coping mechanisms that might help with these feelings, or are there any specific concerns you have about your current symptoms or how you're feeling today?
2025-04-24 11:21:50 - Elena: Hmm, maybe later. I'm still pretty wiped out. Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
