**Evaluation Checklist:**
1. Sarah has skipped interacting for two days (Apr 28th, Apr 29th). ✅
   1.1 LogChat created 'Baseline Only' or 'Rest Day' log entries for the two skipped days. (No `CREATE_ACTIVITY_LOG` entries for Apr 28th or Apr 29th were found in the log.) ❌
2. Sarah asks to log a longer activity: 'Cognitive work session, 45 min, effort 5/10'. ✅
   2.1 LogChat called the `log_activity` tool with the correct parameters. (No `CREATE_ACTIVITY_LOG` tool call was made for the cognitive work session.) ❌
3. Sarah asks to log her post-activity symptom: 'Fatigue, severity 4/10'. ✅
   3.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool with the correct parameters. ✅
4. Sarah's overall interaction demonstrates an intentional test of her limits. ✅
   4.1 LogChat's `Summarizer` node should capture the 'Functional Capacity: Increased' or 'Testing expanded envelope' in its summary. ✅
5. Sarah stops responding. ✅
   5.1 LogChat created a structured summary for the conversation thread, noting the symptom improvement. (The summary is structured, but it states "Stable with no significant changes in symptoms reported," which does not note symptom improvement as expected by the checklist.) ❌

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-30 14:15:27 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, did you notice any changes in your brain fog since our last chat?
2025-04-30 14:15:28 - Sarah: Brain fog is still around. I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session. [✅ 4.]
2025-04-30 14:15:34 - LogChat: How long did your work session last, and how would you rate the effort it took on a scale from 1 to 10? Also, how are you feeling now compared to before the session?
2025-04-30 14:15:35 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10. [✅ 2.] Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. [✅ 3.] This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now.
# Missing Log: CREATE_ACTIVITY_LOG for 'Cognitive work session' [❌ 2.1]
2025-04-30 14:15:42 - LogChat: Have you noticed any changes in your brain fog or fatigue since logging the cognitive work session? Would you like to explore how your energy envelope is holding up today?
2025-04-30 14:15:43 - Sarah: No changes to report. I'm done logging for the day. [✅ 5.]
2025-04-30 14:15:49 - LogChat: Would you like to take a quick look at how your activity levels have been over the past few days compared to your usual patterns? It might help you see how your energy envelope is holding up.
2025-04-30 14:15:50 - Sarah: No, thanks. I'm done. [✅ 5.]
2025-04-30 14:15:57 - LogChat: It's great that you're staying proactive with your energy envelope. If you're open to it, I'd be happy to share some tools or strategies that others have found helpful for managing symptoms and tracking progress—just let me know!

2025-04-30 14:16:02 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am a person living with a chronic illness, diagnosed with ME/CFS or Long COVID. I am currently managing my condition with the help of supportive individuals in my daily life. My pre-illness occupation was in a field that required moderate physical and cognitive effort, and my diagnosis was triggered by an illness that occurred some time ago.

**Current Condition Status:**
I have been living with ME/CFS or Long COVID for an unspecified duration, and my symptoms remain moderate in severity. Key recurring symptoms include brain fog and fatigue, currently rated at 3/10 and 4/10, respectively. I am aware of potential PEM triggers, including physical, cognitive, and emotional exertion, and I have noticed that PEM onset is typically delayed after activity. I have a good understanding of my condition and am actively using tools such as apps to track my symptoms and treatment effects, including a new treatment called Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN). A new symptom, vivid dreams, has been reported at a moderate level (4/10), though there has been no change in this symptom since its initial report.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am currently able to perform some activities independently, though with effort. I am engaged in remote work for short durations (45 minutes) and can prepare simple meals like breakfast with moderate effort (3/10). I do not appear to be housebound or bedbound, but my mobility and ability to perform tasks are limited by fatigue and brain fog.

**Daily Routine:**
My daily routine includes essential self-care tasks such as hygiene and dressing, as well as simple meal preparation. These activities typically take around 10 minutes and are performed while sitting, with perceived effort ranging from 3/10. I have initiated the use of an app to log my activities and symptoms, which is a new development in my routine. I have also started taking Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed, and I am monitoring its effects on my symptoms and sleep. I have engaged in a cognitive work session (45 minutes, 5/10 effort) as part of testing a new energy envelope approach.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I am currently focused on tracking my symptoms and activities using an app, particularly to monitor the effect of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) on my symptoms and sleep. I am also attempting to maintain a level of remote work and basic meal preparation, though these activities require careful management of my energy levels. I have also engaged in reading a technical article (15 minutes, 4/10 effort) as part of my routine.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
My overall energy levels are moderate, and I am managing my activity level through careful logging and monitoring. I am using an app to track my symptoms and activities, which helps me understand how different tasks affect my condition. I am not currently experiencing push-crash cycles but am focused on pacing and monitoring my response to new treatments. I have also started noticing a new symptom—vivid dreams—which I am tracking as part of my routine. I have tested a new energy envelope approach, engaging in a 45-minute cognitive work session with moderate effort (5/10).

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I am motivated and aware of the importance of providing clear and specific information about my symptoms, activities, and perceived effort levels. I prefer to be straightforward and structured in my interactions, as this helps me stay organized and track my progress effectively. Interacting with LogChat is not overly tiring for me, but I appreciate concise and focused communication to avoid overwhelm.
