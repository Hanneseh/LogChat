2025-04-24 22:13:37 - Sarah: Hi LogChat. For today and yesterday, my symptoms were as usual: fatigue and brain fog at a severity of 5/10. I was mostly resting and had no significant activities besides my baseline routine. Today I took my first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed. Last night I had vivid dreams, severity: 4/10. The rest of my day was stable; other activities and symptoms (fatigue, brain fog) were consistent with my baseline and unchanged.
