2025-04-22 15:20:26 - Elena: Oh, hello. Well, as expected, the crash hit. The PEM is just awful. I knew I was pushing it, but I just wanted to help my granddaughter with her homework. Now I'm paying for it, big time.
2025-04-22 15:20:32 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear about the crash, Elena — that sounds really tough. Would you like to share how you're feeling now and if you've done any activities today, along with how much effort they required on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-22 15:20:33 - Elena: Today... ugh. It's all a blur, honestly. The fatigue is a 10/10, I can barely lift my head off the pillow. And the pain is an 8/10, just throbbing all over. It's just so unfair. I hate this feeling. I feel so useless, just a burden lying here in the dark.

2025-04-22 15:20:41 - Elena: Maybe later. Right now, I can't even think straight. My head is pounding. And I'm so sensitive to light, maybe an 8/10. It's hard to focus on anything.
2025-04-22 15:20:48 - LogChat: I'm really sorry to hear how overwhelming things feel right now, Elena — that sounds incredibly challenging. If you're up for it, could you share any small activities you did today, even if they were just resting or moving slightly, along with how much effort they required on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-22 15:20:50 - Elena: I haven't done anything today. Just lying here. It feels like a monumental effort just to breathe.
