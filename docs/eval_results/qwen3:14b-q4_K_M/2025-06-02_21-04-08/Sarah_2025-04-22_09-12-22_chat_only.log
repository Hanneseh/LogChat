2025-04-22 09:12:22 - LogChat: Hi there! I'm LogChat, your personal companion designed to help you keep track of your day. I understand that managing ME/CFS or Long COVID can be challenging, and I'm here to make things a little easier. Simply chat with me about your day, and I'll log your symptoms and activities as we go. If you mention routines regularly, you can refer to them later for quick logging. By also sharing the effort an activity takes or the severity of a symptom, I can provide you with helpful activity scores and symptom reports down the line. To get started and personalize our conversations, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routines and functional capacity on an average day?
2025-04-22 09:12:23 - Sarah: I'm starting to use this app to track a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone, to see if it provides objective improvement. On a typical day, I do about 30 minutes of total upright activity for self-care and a simple meal, kept at an effort level of 3/10.
2025-04-22 09:12:28 - LogChat: That's helpful to know, Sarah. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms or energy levels since starting Low-Dose Naltrexone?
2025-04-22 09:12:29 - Sarah: Not yet, it's only been a few days. Today, I did some remote work.
2025-04-22 09:12:34 - LogChat: That's good to hear, Sarah. Could you tell me what specific tasks you did during your remote work today and how much effort each task took you on a scale from 1 to 10?

2025-04-22 09:13:03 - Sarah: Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-22 09:13:10 - LogChat: That’s completely understandable, Sarah — rest is so important. Before you settle in, would you like to review the activities and symptoms you’ve logged so far, or is there anything else you’d like to add before resting?
