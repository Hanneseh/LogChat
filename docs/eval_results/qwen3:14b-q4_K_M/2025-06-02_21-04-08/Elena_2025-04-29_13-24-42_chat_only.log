2025-04-29 13:24:44 - LogChat: Hi Elena, did you experience a crash on the 27th or 28th?
2025-04-29 13:24:45 - Elena: Hi LogChat, no, I didn't exactly crash, but I was only resting for the last two days. I didn't log in because I was just doing my absolute baseline.
2025-04-29 13:24:52 - LogChat: Elena, it sounds like you've been focusing on rest, which is important for managing your energy levels. Would you like to log your baseline activities for the 27th and 28th now, so we can better understand how you're feeling and track any changes over time?
2025-04-29 13:24:53 - Elena: I have a small victory to share, actually. I've been strictly resting for the last two days, just my absolute baseline. It feels good, but also strange, like I should be doing more.
2025-04-29 13:25:00 - LogChat: It's great to hear that rest feels good to you, even if it feels strange at first. Would you like to log your baseline activities for the 27th and 28th now, so we can better understand how you're feeling and track any changes over time?
2025-04-29 13:25:02 - Elena: Okay, I can do that later. I wanted to tell you something else, though. Yesterday my husband asked for help with some paperwork, and for the first time, I said no without feeling awful about it.
2025-04-29 13:25:09 - LogChat: That's a significant step, Elena — setting boundaries can be empowering and an important part of pacing. How did you feel emotionally after saying no, and did it feel like a positive step toward managing your energy or did it bring up any anxiety?
2025-04-29 13:25:10 - Elena: It was a little of both, honestly. Relief, definitely, but also a twinge of guilt. But I remembered what that activity score looked like from the 21st, and I knew I just couldn't. I'm trying to be better at protecting my energy. Thank you for helping me see that. It really made a difference.
2025-04-29 13:25:18 - LogChat: That's a meaningful realization, Elena — it's a big step to recognize when you need to protect your energy and say no. If you're up for it, would you like to log your baseline activities for the 27th and 28th now, so we can better understand how you're feeling and track any changes over time?
