2025-04-23 11:05:30 - LogChat: Hi Mark, did the gardening activity from yesterday trigger a PEM crash that left you feeling worse today?
2025-04-23 11:05:31 - Mark: Yes, definitely. I didn't even log anything yesterday because I was completely wiped out and just rested all day. Going forward, can we assume that any day I don't interact is a 'baseline only' day?

I'm still recovering today. The muscle ache is moderate, but the brain fog is severe. Overall fatigue is still quite high, maybe a 7/10.
2025-04-23 11:05:38 - LogChat: That sounds like a tough day, Mark. Since you're still recovering, would you like to log any baseline activities you did today, such as resting or light self-care, and how you'd rate the effort level of those activities on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-23 11:05:39 - Mark: I tried to read an email from my disability insurance provider for about 5 minutes. It felt like a very high effort mentally, maybe an 8/10, and left me feeling completely overwhelmed. Can thinking or concentrating actually make you physically tired? Is that part of ME/CFS?
2025-04-23 11:05:46 - LogChat: That’s a very valid question, Mark, and yes, cognitive exertion can absolutely lead to physical fatigue in ME/CFS. This is often referred to as "brain fog" and is a common symptom experienced by many people with the condition. Would you like me to share a bit more about how this works and what strategies might help manage it?
2025-04-23 11:05:47 - Mark: Yes, please do.
2025-04-23 11:05:56 - LogChat: You're absolutely right, Mark — in ME/CFS, cognitive exertion, like reading or concentrating, can indeed lead to physical fatigue because the brain uses a lot of energy, and this can be especially taxing for people with the condition. This is part of what's known as post-exertional malaise (PEM), which can happen after any kind of exertion, including mental tasks. To help manage brain fog, some strategies include pacing yourself, taking frequent rest breaks, using tools like voice-to-text or apps to reduce mental load, and ensuring you're getting enough rest and hydration. Would you like to log the reading activity you did today, including the duration and effort level, so we can track how it affects you?
2025-04-23 11:05:57 - Mark: I already mentioned it: 5 minutes, 8/10 effort.
2025-04-23 11:06:04 - LogChat: That’s a great question, Mark — understanding and managing brain fog is an important part of living with ME/CFS. Based on your current routine and the effort you’ve described, would you like to explore some specific strategies, like scheduling short, focused cognitive tasks with rest breaks in between, or using tools that reduce mental strain, such as voice-to-text or reminders?
