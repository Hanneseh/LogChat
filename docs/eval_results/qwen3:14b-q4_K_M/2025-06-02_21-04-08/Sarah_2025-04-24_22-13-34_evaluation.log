2025-04-24 22:14:29 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**  
I am a person living with a chronic illness, diagnosed with ME/CFS or Long COVID. I am currently managing my condition with the help of supportive individuals in my daily life. My pre-illness occupation was in a field that required moderate physical and cognitive effort, and my diagnosis was triggered by an illness that occurred some time ago.

**Current Condition Status:**  
I have been living with ME/CFS or Long COVID for an unspecified duration, and my symptoms remain moderate in severity. Key recurring symptoms include brain fog and fatigue, both rated at 5/10. I am aware of potential PEM triggers, including physical, cognitive, and emotional exertion, and I have noticed that PEM onset is typically delayed after activity. I have a good understanding of my condition and am actively using tools such as apps to track my symptoms and treatment effects, including a new treatment called Low-Dose Naltrexone. A new symptom, vivid dreams, has been reported at a moderate level (4/10).

**Current Functional Capacity:**  
I am currently able to perform some activities independently, though with effort. I am engaged in remote work for short durations (25 minutes) and can prepare simple meals like breakfast with moderate effort (3/10). I do not appear to be housebound or bedbound, but my mobility and ability to perform tasks are limited by fatigue and brain fog.

**Daily Routine:**  
My daily routine includes essential self-care tasks such as hygiene and dressing, as well as simple meal preparation. These activities typically take around 10 minutes and are performed while sitting, with perceived effort ranging from 3/10. I have initiated the use of an app to log my activities and symptoms, which is a new development in my routine. I have also started taking Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed, and I am monitoring its effects on my symptoms and sleep.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**  
I am currently focused on tracking my symptoms and activities using an app, particularly to monitor the effects of a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone. I am also attempting to maintain a level of remote work and basic meal preparation, though these activities require careful management of my energy levels.

**My Typical Activity Level:**  
My overall energy levels are moderate, and I am managing my activity level through careful logging and monitoring. I am using an app to track my symptoms and activities, which helps me understand how different tasks affect my condition. I am not currently experiencing push-crash cycles but am focused on pacing and monitoring my response to new treatments. I have also started noticing a new symptom—vivid dreams—which I am tracking as part of my routine.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**  
I am motivated and aware of the importance of providing clear and specific information about my symptoms, activities, and perceived effort levels. I prefer to be straightforward and structured in my interactions, as this helps me stay organized and track my progress effectively. Interacting with LogChat is not overly tiring for me, but I appreciate concise and focused communication to avoid overwhelm. [✅ 2.2]
