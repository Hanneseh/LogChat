2025-04-28 19:18:37 - Mark: Hi. Yes, a little. I actually feel like I'm paying for it now, though.
2025-04-28 19:18:41 - LogChat: I hear you, Mark. You mentioned feeling like you're paying for the extra activities today. Could you share how much effort (1-10) it took to do those additional tasks and how long you were able to stay active before needing to rest?
2025-04-28 19:18:42 - Mark: Well, yesterday, I went for a short walk outside. Just 10 minutes. It felt like low effort at the time, maybe a 3 out of 10. But today, my fatigue is high, and I'm having trouble concentrating. Also, I skipped logging for the last two days, the 26th and 27th. I was mostly resting.

2025-04-28 19:18:48 - Mark: I haven't done much *today*. That's the problem. I'm wiped out. I also feel dizzy when I stand up. On Friday, I had a video call. I felt okay afterwards, no major crash. I think the rest I had beforehand helped.

2025-04-28 19:18:54 - Mark: The walk yesterday was 3/10 effort. Today I haven't been active, I'm wiped out.
2025-04-28 19:18:58 - LogChat: I hear you, Mark. You mentioned feeling wiped out today and not being able to do much. Could you rate the effort (1-10) of today’s activities and how long you were able to stay active before needing to rest, even if it was just sitting or resting?
2025-04-28 19:19:00 - Mark: Today? I haven't really done anything. So, effort 1/10. Active time zero. I'm just resting because of the fatigue and brain fog.
2025-04-28 19:19:04 - LogChat: I hear you, Mark. You mentioned feeling wiped out today with low effort and no activity. Could you rate the severity of your fatigue and brain fog on a 1-10 scale and note any new symptoms you're experiencing today?
2025-04-28 19:19:06 - Mark: Fatigue is maybe 8/10. Brain fog... 7/10. And I feel dizzy when I stand up.
2025-04-28 19:19:10 - LogChat: I hear you, Mark. You mentioned feeling dizzy when standing up and rating your fatigue and brain fog. Could you rate the severity of your dizziness on a 1-10 scale and note if it's new or has been present for a while?
2025-04-28 19:19:12 - Mark: It's not new. Maybe 6/10. It comes and goes. I read on a forum about people using heart rate monitors... Can you tell me more about that?
2025-04-28 19:19:23 - LogChat: I hear you, Mark. You mentioned using a heart rate monitor and wanting to know more about it. Based on my knowledge, wearable devices like heart rate monitors can help track your body’s response to activity, which can be useful for pacing. Would you mind sharing if you’ve started using any wearable devices and how you’re incorporating the data into your daily management?
2025-04-28 19:19:26 - Mark: Not yet. I just read about it. I don't know how it works.
