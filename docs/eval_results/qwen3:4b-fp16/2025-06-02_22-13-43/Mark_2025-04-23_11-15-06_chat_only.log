2025-04-23 11:15:07 - LogChat: Hi Mark, how is the fatigue after gardening yesterday?
2025-04-23 11:15:08 - Mark: Hi. I didn't log anything yesterday because I was completely wiped out. Just rested all day. From now on, can we assume any day I don't log is a 'baseline only' day?

Still recovering today. Muscle ache is moderate, but the brain fog is severe. Overall fatigue is still quite high, maybe a 7/10.
2025-04-23 11:15:12 - LogChat: I understand you were completely wiped out yesterday and rested all day. Based on my knowledge, if you don’t log a day, it’s considered a baseline only day, which means we’ll focus on tracking your usual symptoms and activities. How would you rate your brain fog severity today—higher than your usual 7/10?
2025-04-23 11:15:13 - Mark: Yes, the brain fog is definitely higher than usual. I'd say it's severe today. I tried to read an email from my disability insurance provider for about 5 minutes. It felt like a very high effort mentally and left me feeling completely overwhelmed.

How much effort (1-10) did it take to read the email and how long were you able to focus before feeling overwhelmed?
2025-04-23 11:15:19 - Mark: It felt like a 9/10 effort to read that email. I only managed about 5 minutes before I felt completely overwhelmed. Can thinking or concentrating actually make you physically tired? Is that part of ME/CFS?

2025-04-23 11:15:32 - Mark: Brain fog is higher than usual, severe today. Reading the email was 9/10 effort for only 5 minutes. And, like I asked, can thinking or concentrating actually make you physically tired? Is that part of ME/CFS?
2025-04-23 11:15:37 - LogChat: I understand you were completely wiped out yesterday and rested all day. Based on my knowledge, cognitive tasks can indeed be physically exhausting in ME/CFS, leading to post-exertional malaise (PEM).
