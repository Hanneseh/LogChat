2025-04-21 19:27:10 - LogChat: Hi there! I'm LogChat, your personal companion designed to help you keep track of your day. I understand that managing ME/CFS or Long COVID can be challenging, and I'm here to make things a little easier. Simply chat with me about your day, and I'll log your symptoms and activities as we go. If you mention routines regularly, you can refer to them later for quick logging. By also sharing the effort an activity takes or the severity of a symptom, I can provide you with helpful activity scores and symptom reports down the line. To get started and personalize our conversations, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routines and functional capacity on an average day?
2025-04-21 19:27:12 - Elena: Oh, hello LogChat. It's nice to have someone to talk to. Today has been just awful, I feel so drained already. It's not even dinner time yet.
2025-04-21 19:27:16 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear you're feeling so drained today. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your current level of fatigue, and are there any specific symptoms you're experiencing right now?
2025-04-21 19:27:17 - Elena: Well, on a normal day, I mostly stay in bed. My husband helps me to the bathroom, even that takes a lot of effort, even with his help. I'd say that's... oh, I don't know... maybe a 6 out of 10 for effort? But today... today I tried to do more.

2025-04-21 19:27:42 - Elena: He just helps me walk there, really. I use my wheelchair some days, but not always. On an average day, it's still a 6, I think. It's just so hard to move.
