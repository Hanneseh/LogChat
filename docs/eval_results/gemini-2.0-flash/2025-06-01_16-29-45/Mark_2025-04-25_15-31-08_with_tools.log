2025-04-25 15:31:09 - LogChat: Hi Mark, good to see you back after a skipped day. How are you feeling today?
2025-04-25 15:31:10 - Mark: Hi. I'm feeling a bit brighter today, actually. Brain fog is still there, but it's mild. How are you?
2025-04-25 15:31:12 - LogChat: That's encouraging news about feeling a bit brighter today. What activities have you been able to do today, even if they were brief or low-effort?
2025-04-25 15:31:13 - Mark: I had a 15-minute video call with my sister. It was good, but probably moderate emotional and cognitive effort. And I paid a couple of bills online. That was maybe 15 minutes of active time, low-to-moderate effort. I'm resting now after the call, trying to see what happens.

Oh, and my fatigue is much better today, only a 4/10.
2025-04-25 15:31:15 - LogChat: It's great that your fatigue is only a 4/10 today. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the emotional and cognitive effort of the video call with your sister? Also, how would you rate the emotional and cognitive effort of paying bills online on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-25 15:31:16 - Mark: I'd say the video call was a 6/10 for emotional and cognitive effort. Paying bills was maybe a 4/10. I'm trying to be more aware of that kind of effort now.
2025-04-25 15:31:18 - LogChat: That's great you are being more aware of your effort levels. What time did you wake up this morning, and what was the first thing you did?
2025-04-25 15:31:19 - Mark: I woke up around 9 am. The first thing I did was get up and make some tea.
2025-04-25 15:31:21 - LogChat: How long did it take you to make tea, and how would you rate the effort on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-25 15:31:22 - Mark: Making tea only takes about 5 minutes, and it's very low effort, maybe a 2/10.

How do I actually know if I'm pacing correctly? What should I be looking for?
2025-04-25 15:31:23 - RETRIEVE INFORMATION - Args: {"query": "pacing strategies"}
2025-04-25 15:31:25 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, most people find that 'listening to their body' is the most helpful way of pacing, which should help you to gain better control and stabilization of your illness. Pacing also means learning new skills and recognizing your limitations. What other activities have you done today?

2025-04-25 15:31:28 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am experiencing a health condition that is currently causing me significant challenges.

**Current Condition Status:**
I am experiencing symptoms consistent with a chronic illness, possibly ME/CFS or Long COVID. My symptoms fluctuate, and I experience PEM crashes. My key symptoms include fatigue (fluctuating between 4/10 and 9/10), muscle aches (5-8/10), and heart racing (7/10, worse than usual on 2025-04-21). I also experience brain fog (mild to 8/10). I am frustrated by the PEM and how easily it is triggered. Cognitive exertion worsens my symptoms. I am trying to understand ME/CFS symptoms.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
My functional capacity is limited due to my condition. I was "completely wiped out" on 2025-04-23.

**Daily Routine:**
I am only able to perform bare minimum activities, which take me about 20 minutes and require a 7/10 effort on a bad day. I can manage bathroom trips and simple meal preparation. I can also make tea (5m, 2/10 effort).

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
Yesterday, I did some gardening for 20 minutes, which I rated as a 5/10 effort, but this triggered a PEM crash. I also tried reading email for 5 minutes, which required a 9/10 mental effort and worsened my symptoms. Today, I had a video call (15m, 6/10 emotional/cognitive effort) and paid bills online (15m active time, 4/10 effort).

**My Typical Activity Level:**
My activity level is very limited, and I am experiencing push-crash cycles. I am trying to be more aware of effort levels and "listen to my body" for pacing, but I am questioning if I am pacing correctly. I am currently resting after activity.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
