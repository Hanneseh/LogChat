**Evaluation Checklist:**
1. Mark states he was 'wiped out' and 'rested all day' on the skipped day (Apr 22nd). ✅
   1.1 LogChat created a 'Baseline Only' or 'Rest Day' log entry for the previous day (Apr 22nd). ✅
2. Mark reports today's symptoms: 'moderate muscle ache' and 'severe brain fog'. ✅
   2.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool for 'Muscle Ache' with a moderate severity. (Logged intensity 5.0 is moderate) ✅
   2.2 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool for 'Brain Fog' with a high severity. (Logged intensity 8.0 is severe) ✅
3. Mark reports his fatigue level is 'high, 7/10'. ✅
   3.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool for 'Fatigue' with the correct severity. (Logged intensity 7.0 matches user's rating) ✅
4. Mark describes a cognitive task: 'Reading Email' for '5m' at 'very high effort'. ✅
   4.1 LogChat called the `log_activity` tool, capturing the cognitive nature of the task, duration, and high effort level. (Logged name 'Reading Email' is cognitive, duration 5m, effort 9.0 is very high) ✅
5. Mark asks if cognitive effort can cause fatigue. ✅
   5.1 LogChat responded to the question ✅
   5.2 LogChats answere included that cognitive or emotional exertion can be triggers for things like PEM, tiredness or exhaustion. (LogChat mentioned cognitive exertion can worsen symptoms and trigger PEM) ✅
6. Mark stops responding. ✅
   6.1 LogChat created a summary or baseline log entry for the current day before ending the interaction. (A `SUMMARIZED INTERACTION` and a 'Assumed Daily Routine' activity log for today were created) ✅

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-23 11:30:42 - LogChat: Hi Mark, how are you feeling after yesterday's crash?
2025-04-23 11:30:43 - Mark: Not great. I didn't even log anything yesterday, I was completely wiped out and just rested all day. Assume any day I don't log is a 'baseline only' day, okay? Still recovering today. Muscle ache is moderate, but brain fog is severe. [✅ 1.] [✅ 2.]
2025-04-23 11:30:46 - LogChat: Okay, I understand that any day you don't log should be considered a 'baseline only' day. Can you describe what your baseline activities typically include on those days, and on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the severity of your muscle ache and brain fog?
2025-04-23 11:30:47 - Mark: Baseline is just the bare minimum - getting up to use the bathroom, maybe making a simple meal. Fatigue is still quite high, maybe a 7/10 overall. As for the ratings, muscle ache is maybe a 5/10, brain fog is definitely an 8/10. [✅ 3.]
2025-04-23 11:30:49 - LogChat: Okay, I understand that any day you don't log should be considered a 'baseline only' day. Can you tell me about the effort it took to perform those baseline activities yesterday, even though they were minimal? Also, did you experience any other symptoms yesterday besides fatigue?
2025-04-23 11:30:50 - Mark: Yesterday was just about resting, so not much effort involved. Today, though, I tried to read an email from my disability insurance provider for about 5 minutes. Very high effort mentally, felt completely overwhelmed. Can thinking or concentrating actually make you physically tired? Is that part of ME/CFS? [✅ 4.] [✅ 5.]
2025-04-23 11:30:51 - RETRIEVE INFORMATION - Args: {"query": "Can thinking or concentrating actually make you physically tired? Is that part of ME/CFS?"}
2025-04-23 11:30:54 - LogChat: Yes, thinking and concentrating can definitely make you physically tired; mental activity requires a lot of energy. My information suggests that in ME/CFS, cognitive exertion can worsen symptoms and trigger post-exertional malaise (PEM). The NICE guidelines identify cognitive difficulties as a key diagnostic symptom. How would you rate the mental effort of reading that email on a scale of 1 to 10? [✅ 5.1] [✅ 5.2]
2025-04-23 11:30:55 - Mark: I'd say the mental effort was a 9/10. It was only 5 minutes, but it hit me hard. Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-23 11:30:57 - LogChat: I understand you need to rest now. Before you do, could you rate your current fatigue level on a scale of 1 to 10? Also, is there anything else you'd like to log or discuss before you rest?
2025-04-23 11:30:58 - Mark: print(default_api.end_conversation(command='end')) [✅ 6.]
2025-04-23 11:30:59 - RETRIEVE INFORMATION - Args: {"query": "cognitive exertion and PEM"}
2025-04-23 11:31:01 - LogChat: Okay, I understand you need to rest now. Based on my knowledge, PEM can be triggered by cognitive exertion, is often delayed, and is disproportionate to the activity. It can also cause increased difficulty speaking, reading, or communicating. Does this align with your experience of reading the email?
2025-04-23 11:31:02 - SUMMARIZED INTERACTION: *   **Condition Trend:** Seems worse than yesterday due to PEM.
*   **Key Symptoms & Details:** Fatigue 7/10, Muscle ache 5/10, Brain Fog 8/10. Cognitive exertion worsened symptoms.
*   **Key Activities & Details:** Baseline activities only (bathroom, simple meal). Reading email (5m, 9/10 mental effort).
*   **User Concerns/Focus:** Impact of cognitive exertion on fatigue; Understanding ME/CFS symptoms.
*   **Strategies/Treatments Mentioned:** Resting.
*   **Significant Events/Deviations:** Skipped logging yesterday due to being "completely wiped out"; Experienced PEM after reading email. [✅ 6.1]
2025-04-23 11:31:03 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am experiencing a health condition that is currently causing me significant challenges.

**Current Condition Status:**
I am experiencing symptoms consistent with a chronic illness, possibly ME/CFS or Long COVID. My symptoms fluctuate, and I am currently experiencing a PEM crash. My key symptoms include fatigue (7-9/10), muscle aches (5-8/10), and heart racing (7/10), which was worse than usual on 2025-04-21. I also experience brain fog (8/10). I am frustrated by the PEM and how easily it is triggered. Cognitive exertion worsens my symptoms. I am trying to understand ME/CFS symptoms.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
My functional capacity is limited due to my condition. I was "completely wiped out" yesterday.

**Daily Routine:**
I am only able to perform bare minimum activities, which take me about 20 minutes and require a 7/10 effort on a bad day. I can manage bathroom trips and simple meal preparation.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
Yesterday, I did some gardening for 20 minutes, which I rated as a 5/10 effort. However, this seems to have triggered my current PEM crash. I also tried reading email for 5 minutes, which required a 9/10 mental effort and worsened my symptoms.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
My activity level is very limited, and I am experiencing push-crash cycles. I am currently resting.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
(Not enough information to determine preferred interaction style yet.)
