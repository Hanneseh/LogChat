2025-04-30 14:36:28 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, good to see you back after a couple of days - how have you been feeling?
2025-04-30 14:36:29 - Sarah: I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session.
2025-04-30 14:36:31 - LogChat: I'm glad you're testing your energy envelope today. How long do you plan to work, and what effort level (1-10) do you anticipate?
2025-04-30 14:36:31 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10.
2025-04-30 14:36:33 - LogChat: Thanks for logging that. How are you feeling now, after the cognitive work session? On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your brain fog and fatigue now compared to before the session?
2025-04-30 14:36:34 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10.
2025-04-30 14:36:36 - LogChat: Okay, thanks for logging your fatigue. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your brain fog now, compared to before the session?
2025-04-30 14:36:37 - Sarah: This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now.
2025-04-30 14:36:40 - LogChat: That's great that the work session didn't increase your brain fog as much as you expected. Do you have any other activities or symptoms you'd like to log for today?
2025-04-30 14:36:40 - Sarah: No, I'm done logging for the day.
2025-04-30 14:36:43 - LogChat: It's great that you're learning more about your energy envelope. What did you learn about your limits and how you felt during and after the work session?
