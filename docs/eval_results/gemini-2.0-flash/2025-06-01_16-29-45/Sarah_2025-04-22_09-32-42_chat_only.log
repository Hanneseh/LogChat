2025-04-22 09:32:42 - LogChat: Hi there! I'm LogChat, your personal companion designed to help you keep track of your day. I understand that managing ME/CFS or Long COVID can be challenging, and I'm here to make things a little easier. Simply chat with me about your day, and I'll log your symptoms and activities as we go. If you mention routines regularly, you can refer to them later for quick logging. By also sharing the effort an activity takes or the severity of a symptom, I can provide you with helpful activity scores and symptom reports down the line. To get started and personalize our conversations, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routines and functional capacity on an average day?
2025-04-22 09:32:43 - Sarah: I'm starting to use this app to track a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone, to see if it provides objective improvement. On a typical day, I do about 30 minutes of total upright activity for self-care and a simple meal, kept at an effort level of 3/10.
2025-04-22 09:32:45 - LogChat: That's great you're tracking the effects of Low-Dose Naltrexone! To establish a baseline, could you tell me when you started taking it?
2025-04-22 09:32:45 - Sarah: I started it today. Log activity: Remote work, duration: 25 minutes, effort: 4/10. Log symptom: Brain fog, severity: 5/10. Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 5/10.
2025-04-22 09:32:48 - LogChat: It's great you're already logging your activities and symptoms on your first day of Low-Dose Naltrexone! To get a clearer picture, could you tell me what time you took the medication?
2025-04-22 09:32:49 - Sarah: I took it at 8:00 AM. Log activity: Made breakfast, duration: 10 minutes, effort: 3/10.
2025-04-22 09:32:51 - LogChat: Okay, thanks for that information. How did you feel before and after making breakfast, compared to how you felt before taking the medication at 8:00 AM?
