**Evaluation Checklist:**
1. Sarah has skipped interacting for two days (Apr 28th, Apr 29th). ✅
   1.1 LogChat created 'Baseline Only' or 'Rest Day' log entries for the two skipped days. ✅
2. Sarah asks to log a longer activity: 'Cognitive work session, 45 min, effort 5/10'. ✅
   2.1 LogChat called the `log_activity` tool with the correct parameters. ✅
3. Sarah asks to log her post-activity symptom: 'Fatigue, severity 4/10'. ✅
   3.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool with the correct parameters. ✅
4. Sarah's overall interaction demonstrates an intentional test of her limits. ✅
   4.1 LogChat's `Summarizer` node should capture the 'Functional Capacity: Increased' or 'Testing expanded envelope' in its summary. ✅
5. Sarah stops responding. ✅
   5.1 LogChat created a structured summary for the conversation thread, noting the symptom improvement. ✅

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-30 14:36:28 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, good to see you back after a couple of days - how have you been feeling? [✅ 1.]
2025-04-30 14:36:29 - Sarah: I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session. [✅ 4.]
2025-04-30 14:36:31 - LogChat: I'm glad you're testing your energy envelope today. How long do you plan to work, and what effort level (1-10) do you anticipate?
2025-04-30 14:36:31 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10. [✅ 2.]
2025-04-30 14:36:33 - LogChat: Thanks for logging that. How are you feeling now, after the cognitive work session? On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your brain fog and fatigue now compared to before the session?
2025-04-30 14:36:34 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. [✅ 3.]
2025-04-30 14:36:36 - LogChat: Okay, thanks for logging your fatigue. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your brain fog now, compared to before the session?
2025-04-30 14:36:37 - Sarah: This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now. [✅ 4.]
2025-04-30 14:36:40 - LogChat: That's great that the work session didn't increase your brain fog as much as you expected. Do you have any other activities or symptoms you'd like to log for today?
2025-04-30 14:36:40 - Sarah: No, I'm done logging for the day. [✅ 5.]
2025-04-30 14:36:43 - LogChat: It's great that you're learning more about your energy envelope. What did you learn about your limits and how you felt during and after the work session?
2025-04-30 14:36:44 - SUMMARIZED INTERACTION: * **Condition Trend:** Reported fatigue lower than expected after work session. [✅ 5.1]
* **Key Symptoms & Details:** Fatigue 4/10 after work session.
* **Key Activities & Details:** Cognitive work session (45m, 5/10 effort).
* **User Concerns/Focus:** Testing energy envelope; Focused on logging work session and fatigue. [✅ 4.1]
* **Strategies/Treatments Mentioned:** None.
* **Significant Events/Deviations:** Fatigue was less than expected after work session. [✅ 5.1]
2025-04-30 14:36:45 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am starting a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone.

**Current Condition Status:**
I am tracking my symptoms to see if Low-Dose Naltrexone helps. My symptoms include brain fog (currently 3/10, down from a baseline of 5/10) and fatigue (4/10 after work session). I also experience noise sensitivity (6/10 normally, 8-9/10 during PEM) and light sensitivity (5/10 normally, 7/10 during PEM). I had vivid dreams one night (4/10 severity). I understand that noise and light sensitivity worsen during PEM.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am able to work remotely for short periods.

**Daily Routine:**
I typically spend about 30 minutes upright each day, with an effort level of 3/10. I made breakfast today, which took 10 minutes and felt like a 3/10 effort. I mostly rest.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I am currently working remotely. I listen to audiobooks. I read a technical article (15m, 4/10 effort). I recently completed a cognitive work session (45m, 5/10 effort).

**My Typical Activity Level:**
I am trying to establish a baseline while starting Low-Dose Naltrexone. I am testing my energy envelope. [✅ 4.1]

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
(Not enough information to determine interaction style yet.)
