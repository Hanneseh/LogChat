2025-04-25 15:31:09 - LogChat: Hi Mark, good to see you back after a skipped day. How are you feeling today?
2025-04-25 15:31:10 - Mark: Hi. I'm feeling a bit brighter today, actually. Brain fog is still there, but it's mild. How are you?
2025-04-25 15:31:12 - LogChat: That's encouraging news about feeling a bit brighter today. What activities have you been able to do today, even if they were brief or low-effort?
2025-04-25 15:31:13 - Mark: I had a 15-minute video call with my sister. It was good, but probably moderate emotional and cognitive effort. And I paid a couple of bills online. That was maybe 15 minutes of active time, low-to-moderate effort. I'm resting now after the call, trying to see what happens.

Oh, and my fatigue is much better today, only a 4/10.
2025-04-25 15:31:15 - LogChat: It's great that your fatigue is only a 4/10 today. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the emotional and cognitive effort of the video call with your sister? Also, how would you rate the emotional and cognitive effort of paying bills online on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-25 15:31:16 - Mark: I'd say the video call was a 6/10 for emotional and cognitive effort. Paying bills was maybe a 4/10. I'm trying to be more aware of that kind of effort now.
2025-04-25 15:31:18 - LogChat: That's great you are being more aware of your effort levels. What time did you wake up this morning, and what was the first thing you did?
2025-04-25 15:31:19 - Mark: I woke up around 9 am. The first thing I did was get up and make some tea.
2025-04-25 15:31:21 - LogChat: How long did it take you to make tea, and how would you rate the effort on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-25 15:31:22 - Mark: Making tea only takes about 5 minutes, and it's very low effort, maybe a 2/10.

How do I actually know if I'm pacing correctly? What should I be looking for?
2025-04-25 15:31:25 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, most people find that 'listening to their body' is the most helpful way of pacing, which should help you to gain better control and stabilization of your illness. Pacing also means learning new skills and recognizing your limitations. What other activities have you done today?
