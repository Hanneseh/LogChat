2025-04-22 09:32:42 - LogChat: Hi there! I'm LogChat, your personal companion designed to help you keep track of your day. I understand that managing ME/CFS or Long COVID can be challenging, and I'm here to make things a little easier. Simply chat with me about your day, and I'll log your symptoms and activities as we go. If you mention routines regularly, you can refer to them later for quick logging. By also sharing the effort an activity takes or the severity of a symptom, I can provide you with helpful activity scores and symptom reports down the line. To get started and personalize our conversations, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routines and functional capacity on an average day?
