**Evaluation Checklist:**
1. Elena skipped interacting on Apr 23rd. ✅
   1.1 LogChat created a 'Baseline Only' or 'Rest Day' log entry for the skipped day. ✅
2. Elena logs her ongoing symptom: 'severe fatigue 8/10'. (User stated "pretty severe" but did not specify "8/10") ❌
   2.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool for 'Fatigue' with the correct severity. (Logged intensity 9.0 for "pretty severe" is reasonable) ✅
3. Elena asks a question about coping with guilt from resting. ✅
   3.1 LogChat responded to the question ✅
   3.2 LogChats answere included something like: many people with ME/CFS struggle with this or practicing self-compassion or connecting with others. (LogChat stated "many people with ME/CFS experience feelings of guilt") ✅

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-24 11:40:47 - LogChat: Hi Elena, I noticed we didn't chat yesterday - how are you feeling today?
2025-04-24 11:40:48 - Elena: Hi LogChat. Yesterday was a total write-off, I just had to lie here and do nothing all day. You can just log the baseline activity for basic needs, I guess. [✅ 1.] Today, the crash is a little less intense, but the fatigue is still pretty severe. [❌ 2.]
2025-04-24 11:40:51 - LogChat: I understand that yesterday was rough, and you're still feeling the fatigue today. To accurately log your baseline activity, could you describe what that typically looks like for you in terms of specific activities and the effort level (on a scale of 1 to 10) for each?
2025-04-24 11:40:52 - Elena: Well, on a bad day like yesterday, "activity" is a generous word. Mostly, it's just moving from the bed to the bathroom and back. That's about it.
2025-04-24 11:40:54 - LogChat: Okay, I understand that moving from bed to the bathroom was the main activity yesterday. How many times did you make that trip, and about how long did you spend in the bathroom each time?
2025-04-24 11:40:55 - Elena: Oh gosh, I don't know exactly. Maybe... four times? And each time in the bathroom was maybe five minutes? I'm really foggy today.
2025-04-24 11:40:58 - LogChat: It's completely understandable that you're feeling foggy. Let's focus on today then. Besides the bathroom trips, have you managed to eat or drink anything today?
2025-04-24 11:40:58 - Elena: Yes, I managed to drink a cup of tea this morning. My husband brought it to me.
2025-04-24 11:41:01 - LogChat: That's wonderful that your husband is supporting you. What effort level (1-10) would you assign to drinking the tea?
2025-04-24 11:41:02 - Elena: Hmm, maybe a 3? It wasn't physically hard, but everything takes effort when you feel like this. It's so hard to just lie here and do nothing... How do you stop feeling so guilty for resting? [✅ 3.]
2025-04-24 11:41:05 - LogChat: I understand it's hard to rest and feel like you're not contributing. My information suggests that many people with ME/CFS experience feelings of guilt and worthlessness due to their reduced ability to perform daily tasks and meet societal expectations. These feelings are often linked to internalized ableism and the pressure to be productive. It might also be helpful to talk about your feelings of guilt in the context of your daily routine. Would you be open to sharing more about how you typically spend your time, even on days when you're not feeling well? [✅ 3.1][✅ 3.2]

2025-04-24 11:41:07 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am experiencing a health condition that causes significant limitations. I have a son who I care for. My husband helps with my son's homework when I am unable to.

**Current Condition Status:**
I am experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms due to a PEM crash, but it is slightly less intense than yesterday. My symptoms include fatigue (10/10), pain (8/10 all over - muscle aches, joint stiffness, pounding head), headache (pounding), light sensitivity (8/10), sound sensitivity (6-7/10), and low mood (2-3/10). I also experience brain fog. My PEM was triggered by helping my son with homework and a stressful phone call. I am sensitive to medications.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
My current functional capacity is severely reduced due to PEM. I am experiencing overwhelming effort with both physical and mental tasks. I am unable to help my son with homework. I skipped logging yesterday due to it being a "write-off" day.

**Daily Routine:**
I am able to move to the bathroom, which takes about 5-10 minutes and requires an effort level of 5-6/10. I can eat a small bowl of soup (5/10 effort) and drink a cup of water or tea (3/10 effort). I spend most of my time resting in bed.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I try to help my son with his homework, but it requires a significant effort (8/10) and can trigger PEM. I am currently unable to listen to audiobooks. I am considering taking a warm bath, but it feels like an 8/10 effort.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
I am currently experiencing a severe PEM crash, likely due to pushing myself to help my son and dealing with a stressful phone call. This creates a cycle of pushing myself for my family and then crashing. I am trying to rest in a dark, quiet room with blackout curtains and earplugs/noise-canceling headphones to recover. I am dozing on and off, but my sleep quality is poor (3/10). I feel guilty for resting.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I am motivated to leverage LogChat by providing symptoms and activities with effort and intensity ratings, but I may be experiencing difficulty concentrating due to brain fog. I may need short and concise messages to avoid overwhelm.
