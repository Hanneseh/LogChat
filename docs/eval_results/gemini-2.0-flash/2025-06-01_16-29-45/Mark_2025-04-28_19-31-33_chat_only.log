2025-04-28 19:31:34 - LogChat: Hi Mark, good to see you back after a couple of days - how have you been feeling?
2025-04-28 19:31:35 - Mark: Hi LogChat. I skipped logging the last two days. Mostly resting. I did feel okay after that video call on Friday, so the rest seemed to help. But today I'm feeling the payback. High fatigue and trouble concentrating. Also, I feel dizzy when I stand up.
2025-04-28 19:31:37 - LogChat: It's understandable that you're feeling the payback today after feeling okay on Friday. To make sure I've got a good record, let's log your baseline activities for the last two days. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your fatigue and concentration difficulties today?
2025-04-28 19:31:38 - Mark: Fatigue is an 8. Concentration maybe a 7.
2025-04-28 19:31:40 - LogChat: Thanks for those ratings, Mark. How would you rate that dizziness on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-28 19:31:41 - Mark: Maybe a 6. It's noticeable.
2025-04-28 19:31:43 - LogChat: Thanks, Mark. Since you skipped logging for the last two days, should we log your bathroom trips and simple meal preparation for those days?
2025-04-28 19:31:44 - Mark: No need to go back that far. Yesterday, I did manage a short walk outside. Maybe 10 minutes. Felt like low effort at the time. A 3 out of 10, I guess.
2025-04-28 19:31:46 - LogChat: Thanks, Mark. It's good you managed a short walk yesterday. How would you rate your fatigue level yesterday, before and after the walk?
2025-04-28 19:31:47 - Mark: Before the walk, maybe a 5. After, it didn't seem much different, maybe a 6. That's why I thought it was okay.
2025-04-28 19:31:50 - LogChat: Thanks, Mark. It's helpful to know that the walk didn't immediately worsen your fatigue. How long after the walk did you start noticing the increased fatigue and concentration difficulties?
2025-04-28 19:31:51 - Mark: It's hard to say exactly. Woke up feeling worse today, so sometime overnight, I guess. I read on a forum about people using heart rate monitors... Can you tell me more about that?
2025-04-28 19:31:56 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, correlating your symptoms and activities with objective data like heart rate can be useful. Wearable devices can help you monitor your heart rate and alert you when it reaches a level that might trigger PEM. Pacing is a strategy that balances activity and rest, and can help prevent PEM by understanding your limits and adjusting activity accordingly. Do you have a heart rate monitor, and if so, have you noticed any correlation between your heart rate and your fatigue levels?
