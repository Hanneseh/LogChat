**Conversation Log:**
2025-05-03 11:36:50 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, good to see you back after a couple of days - how are you feeling? [✅ 1.]
2025-05-03 11:36:51 - Sarah: Brain fog is still improved. Fatigue is stable. I'd like to use the data to verify my perceived improvements. I need you to retrieve some activity scores.
2025-05-03 11:36:52 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-21", "time_period_end": "2025-04-27"}
2025-05-03 11:36:55 - LogChat: I have retrieved your activity scores from April 21st to April 27th: April 21st: 0.0, April 22nd: 220.0, April 23rd: 60.0, April 24th: 60.0, April 25th: 60.0, April 26th: 60.0, April 27th: 120.0, with an average daily score (on active days) of 96.7. Would you like me to present them day by day, or would you prefer a summary of the average activity level during that period?
2025-05-03 11:36:55 - Sarah: Can you retrieve my calculated activity score for April 22nd? That was a baseline day before I started the medication. [✅ 2.]
2025-05-03 11:36:56 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-22", "time_period_end": "2025-04-22"} [✅ 2.1] [✅ 2.2]
2025-05-03 11:36:58 - LogChat: Your activity score for April 22nd was 220.0. Does this align with your memory of that day as a baseline before starting the medication?
2025-05-03 11:36:59 - Sarah: Yes. Now, can you retrieve the activity score for April 30th, the day I did the longer work session? [✅ 3.]
2025-05-03 11:37:00 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-30", "time_period_end": "2025-04-30"} [✅ 3.1] [✅ 3.2]
2025-05-03 11:37:02 - LogChat: Your activity score for April 30th was 285.0. How does this compare to your baseline day on April 22nd, which had a score of 220.0? Does the difference reflect how you felt on those days, or does it give you any insights into the impact of the longer work session?
2025-05-03 11:37:03 - Sarah: Perfect. Please show me the comparison of those two scores. [✅ 4.] [✅ 5.]
2025-05-03 11:37:05 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-22", "time_period_end": "2025-04-22"}
2025-05-03 11:37:05 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-30", "time_period_end": "2025-04-30"}
2025-05-03 11:37:07 - LogChat: On April 22nd, your activity score was 220.0, while on April 30th, it was 285.0. Does this difference of 65.0 align with your perceived effort and fatigue levels on those days, especially considering the longer work session on April 30th? [✅ 4.1]

2025-05-03 11:37:09 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am starting a new treatment, Low-Dose Naltrexone.

**Current Condition Status:**
I am tracking my symptoms to see if Low-Dose Naltrexone helps. My symptoms include brain fog (currently 3/10, down from a baseline of 5/10) and fatigue (4/10 after work session). I also experience noise sensitivity (6/10 normally, 8-9/10 during PEM) and light sensitivity (5/10 normally, 7/10 during PEM). I had vivid dreams one night (4/10 severity). I understand that noise and light sensitivity worsen during PEM. I am seeing improvements in brain fog.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am able to work remotely for short periods.

**Daily Routine:**
I typically spend about 30 minutes upright each day, with an effort level of 3/10. I made breakfast today, which took 10 minutes and felt like a 3/10 effort. I mostly rest.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I am currently working remotely. I listen to audiobooks. I read a technical article (15m, 4/10 effort). I recently completed a cognitive work session (45m, 5/10 effort). I am reviewing my activity scores.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
I am trying to establish a baseline while starting Low-Dose Naltrexone. I am testing my energy envelope.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
(Not enough information to determine interaction style yet.)
