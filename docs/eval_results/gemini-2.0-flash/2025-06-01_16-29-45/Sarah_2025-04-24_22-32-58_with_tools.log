2025-04-24 22:32:58 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, how are you feeling after starting Low-Dose Naltrexone?
2025-04-24 22:32:59 - Sarah: Hi LogChat. Yesterday and today were mostly rest days, just my usual baseline routine. Symptoms were consistent: fatigue and brain fog at 5/10. Took first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed today. Also, vivid dreams last night, severity: 4/10. Otherwise, stable.
2025-04-24 22:33:01 - LogChat: Since you started Low-Dose Naltrexone two days ago, have you noticed any changes in your fatigue or brain fog?
2025-04-24 22:33:02 - Sarah: No significant changes in fatigue or brain fog. Still at 5/10 for both yesterday and today. My other activities and symptoms were consistent with my baseline and unchanged.
2025-04-24 22:33:04 - LogChat: Okay, since your fatigue and brain fog are consistent, and your activities are at your baseline, that's good to know. Did you also experience vivid dreams the night before last, and if so, how would you rate their severity on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-24 22:33:05 - Sarah: No vivid dreams the night before last. Only last night, rated 4/10.
2025-04-24 22:33:07 - LogChat: Okay, so the vivid dreams were only last night and rated 4/10. Do you have any thoughts on what might have caused the vivid dreams last night?
2025-04-24 22:33:08 - Sarah: Likely related to starting the Low-Dose Naltrexone.
2025-04-24 22:33:10 - LogChat: Okay, it sounds like the vivid dreams might be a side effect of the Low-Dose Naltrexone. Besides the fatigue, brain fog, and vivid dreams, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
2025-04-24 22:33:11 - Sarah: No other symptoms to report. Just fatigue and brain fog at 5/10, and the vivid dreams last night. Everything else is stable.
2025-04-24 22:33:14 - LogChat: Okay, so no other symptoms besides the fatigue, brain fog, and vivid dreams. Since starting Low-Dose Naltrexone, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?
2025-04-24 22:33:15 - Sarah: Sleep patterns were normal except for the vivid dreams. Appetite unchanged.
2025-04-24 22:33:18 - LogChat: Okay, so your sleep patterns and appetite are unchanged since starting Low-Dose Naltrexone. Since starting Low-Dose Naltrexone, have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels?
2025-04-24 22:33:19 - Sarah: No changes in mood or energy levels. Still at baseline.
2025-04-24 22:33:23 - LogChat: Okay, so no changes in mood or energy levels since starting Low-Dose Naltrexone. Are you tracking your mood and energy levels on a regular basis, and if so, how often do you track them?
2025-04-24 22:33:25 - Sarah: Yes, I'm tracking them daily. Along with fatigue and brain fog.
2025-04-24 22:33:29 - LogChat: Okay, so you're tracking your mood and energy levels daily along with fatigue and brain fog. Are you rating your mood and energy levels on a scale of 1 to 10, similar to how you're rating your fatigue and brain fog?
2025-04-24 22:33:31 - Sarah: Not consistently, but I can start doing that if it's helpful. Right now just focusing on fatigue and brain fog as primary indicators.
2025-04-24 22:33:34 - LogChat: Okay, since you're focusing on fatigue and brain fog as primary indicators, how would you rate your mood and energy levels today on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-24 22:33:35 - Sarah: Mood 6/10, energy 3/10. But those are typical for me.
2025-04-24 22:33:39 - LogChat: Okay, so a mood of 6/10 and an energy level of 3/10 are typical for you. Could you describe what a typical day looks like when your mood and energy levels are at those ratings?
2025-04-24 22:33:40 - Sarah: Mostly resting with short bursts of low-effort activity. Remote work for about 25 minutes, making breakfast for 10 minutes. Upright activity limited to around 30 minutes total.
2025-04-24 22:33:44 - LogChat: Okay, so on a typical day you're mostly resting with short bursts of low-effort activity. What does your resting look like? Do you listen to music, read, or watch TV?
2025-04-24 22:33:45 - Sarah: Mostly lying down in a quiet, dark room. Sometimes listen to audiobooks. Avoiding screens as much as possible.
2025-04-24 22:33:49 - LogChat: Okay, so you're mostly lying down in a quiet, dark room and sometimes listen to audiobooks to rest while avoiding screens. What kind of audiobooks do you enjoy listening to?
2025-04-24 22:33:50 - Sarah: Non-fiction, mostly science and history. Something engaging but not too demanding.
2025-04-24 22:33:54 - LogChat: Okay, so you enjoy non-fiction audiobooks, mostly science and history, that are engaging but not too demanding. Do you find that listening to audiobooks is more or less demanding than reading or watching TV?
2025-04-24 22:33:56 - Sarah: Less demanding than reading, much less than TV. I can close my eyes and just listen.
2025-04-24 22:34:00 - LogChat: Okay, so listening to audiobooks is less demanding than reading and much less than TV because you can close your eyes and just listen. Do you find that listening to audiobooks is more or less demanding than talking to friends or family on the phone?
2025-04-24 22:34:01 - Sarah: Depends on the conversation. A casual chat is fine, but anything emotionally intense is draining. Audiobooks are generally less demanding.
2025-04-24 22:34:06 - LogChat: Okay, so audiobooks are generally less demanding than emotionally intense conversations with friends or family. Do you find it easier to listen to audiobooks alone or with someone else?
2025-04-24 22:34:08 - Sarah: Alone. I need to control the pace and volume.
2025-04-24 22:34:14 - LogChat: Okay, so you prefer listening to audiobooks alone since you need to control the pace and volume. What is the typical volume you listen to audiobooks at, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being barely audible and 10 being very loud?
2025-04-24 22:34:17 - Sarah: Very low, around 2 or 3. I'm sensitive to noise.
2025-04-24 22:34:23 - LogChat: Okay, so you listen to audiobooks at a very low volume, around 2 or 3, because you're sensitive to noise. Do you find that your sensitivity to noise has changed since starting Low-Dose Naltrexone?
2025-04-24 22:34:26 - Sarah: No change. Noise sensitivity is consistent.
2025-04-24 22:34:31 - LogChat: Okay, so your noise sensitivity is consistent and hasn't changed since starting Low-Dose Naltrexone. Have you always been sensitive to noise, or is this a symptom that developed with your condition?
2025-04-24 22:34:33 - Sarah: Developed with the condition. It's worse when I'm experiencing PEM.
2025-04-24 22:34:38 - LogChat: Okay, so your noise sensitivity developed with your condition and is worse when you're experiencing PEM. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being barely noticeable and 10 being extremely debilitating, how would you rate your noise sensitivity on a typical day?
2025-04-24 22:34:42 - Sarah: Around 6/10 on a typical day. Higher during PEM.
2025-04-24 22:34:50 - LogChat: Okay, so your noise sensitivity is around 6/10 on a typical day. How would you rate your noise sensitivity during PEM, on that same scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-24 22:34:53 - Sarah: 8 or 9, depending on the severity of the PEM.
2025-04-24 22:34:59 - LogChat: Okay, so your noise sensitivity is around 6/10 on a typical day and 8 or 9 during PEM. Besides noise, what other sensitivities do you experience, and how would you rate them on a scale of 1 to 10 on a typical day and during PEM?
2025-04-24 22:35:01 - Sarah: Light sensitivity is also an issue. Maybe 5/10 normally, 7/10 during PEM.
2025-04-24 22:35:07 - LogChat: Okay, so your light sensitivity is around 5/10 normally and 7/10 during PEM. What kind of lights bother you the most? Are we talking about sunlight, fluorescent lights, or something else?
2025-04-24 22:35:09 - Sarah: Fluorescent lights are the worst. Sunlight is manageable with sunglasses.
2025-04-24 22:35:14 - LogChat: Okay, so fluorescent lights are the worst for you, and sunlight is manageable with sunglasses. What specific qualities of fluorescent lights make them particularly bothersome compared to sunlight? Is it the brightness, the flicker, the color temperature, or something else?
2025-04-24 22:35:17 - Sarah: Probably the flicker and the harshness of the light. It feels very jarring.
2025-04-24 22:35:22 - LogChat: Okay, so the flicker and harshness of fluorescent lights make them particularly bothersome. Do you have to deal with fluorescent lights often, and if so, where and for how long?
2025-04-24 22:35:25 - Sarah: Not often, thankfully. Mostly when I have to go to medical appointments. I try to minimize my time in those environments.
2025-04-24 22:35:31 - LogChat: Okay, so the flicker and harshness of fluorescent lights make them particularly bothersome, and you encounter them during medical appointments. Do you have any strategies for managing the flicker and harshness of fluorescent lights during medical appointments?
2025-04-24 22:35:33 - Sarah: I wear sunglasses indoors and try to focus on something else. Sometimes I ask if they can dim the lights.
2025-04-24 22:35:39 - LogChat: Okay, so you wear sunglasses indoors and try to focus on something else to manage the flicker and harshness of fluorescent lights during medical appointments. What kind of sunglasses do you wear indoors, and do they have a specific tint or filter that helps with the fluorescent lights?
2025-04-24 22:35:41 - Sarah: Just regular sunglasses with a dark tint. Nothing special. They just help to reduce the overall brightness. Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-24 22:35:47 - LogChat: Okay, Sarah, thanks for sharing. Rest well.
