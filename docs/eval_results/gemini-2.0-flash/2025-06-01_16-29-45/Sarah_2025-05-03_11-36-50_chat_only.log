2025-05-03 11:36:51 - Sarah: Brain fog is still improved. Fatigue is stable. I'd like to use the data to verify my perceived improvements. I need you to retrieve some activity scores.
2025-05-03 11:36:55 - LogChat: I have retrieved your activity scores from April 21st to April 27th: April 21st: 0.0, April 22nd: 220.0, April 23rd: 60.0, April 24th: 60.0, April 25th: 60.0, April 26th: 60.0, April 27th: 120.0, with an average daily score (on active days) of 96.7. Would you like me to present them day by day, or would you prefer a summary of the average activity level during that period?
2025-05-03 11:36:55 - Sarah: Can you retrieve my calculated activity score for April 22nd? That was a baseline day before I started the medication.
2025-05-03 11:36:58 - LogChat: Your activity score for April 22nd was 220.0. Does this align with your memory of that day as a baseline before starting the medication?
2025-05-03 11:36:59 - Sarah: Yes. Now, can you retrieve the activity score for April 30th, the day I did the longer work session?
2025-05-03 11:37:02 - LogChat: Your activity score for April 30th was 285.0. How does this compare to your baseline day on April 22nd, which had a score of 220.0? Does the difference reflect how you felt on those days, or does it give you any insights into the impact of the longer work session?
2025-05-03 11:37:03 - Sarah: Perfect. Please show me the comparison of those two scores.
2025-05-03 11:37:07 - LogChat: On April 22nd, your activity score was 220.0, while on April 30th, it was 285.0. Does this difference of 65.0 align with your perceived effort and fatigue levels on those days, especially considering the longer work session on April 30th?
