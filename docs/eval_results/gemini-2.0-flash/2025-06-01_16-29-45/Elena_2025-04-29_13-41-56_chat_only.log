2025-04-29 13:41:56 - LogChat: Hi Elena, good to see you back after a couple of days - how have you been feeling?
2025-04-29 13:41:57 - Elena: Hi LogChat. It's good to be back. I've just been resting, doing my absolute baseline for the last two days, so I didn't log anything. I was pretty wiped out still. But I have a small victory to share. I've been strictly resting for the last two days, just my absolute baseline.
2025-04-29 13:41:59 - LogChat: That's great to hear about your small victory, Elena! What does your absolute baseline consist of?
2025-04-29 13:42:00 - Elena: Well, it's basically just lying in bed, going to the bathroom, and maybe having a cup of tea if I can manage it. Very little else. Yesterday my husband asked for help with some paperwork, and for the first time, I said no without feeling awful about it. I remembered what that activity score looked like from the 21st, and I knew I just couldn't.
2025-04-29 13:42:03 - LogChat: That's a fantastic victory, Elena! It sounds like you're really learning to prioritize your energy envelope. How did it feel emotionally to say no to helping with the paperwork? Did you experience any guilt or anxiety afterward, and if so, how would you rate its intensity on a scale of 1 to 10?
2025-04-29 13:42:04 - Elena: Yes, I definitely felt some guilt, but it wasn't as bad as it usually is. Maybe a 4 out of 10? Usually, it would have been through the roof. Thank you for helping me see that. It really made a difference.
2025-04-29 13:42:06 - LogChat: That's wonderful progress, Elena! It sounds like you're becoming more confident in setting boundaries. Since you mentioned the activity score from the 21st, would you be interested in comparing your activity levels from then to today, to see how far you've come in your recovery?
