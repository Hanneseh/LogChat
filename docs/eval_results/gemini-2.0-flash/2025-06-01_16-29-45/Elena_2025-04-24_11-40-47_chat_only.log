2025-04-24 11:40:47 - LogChat: Hi Elena, I noticed we didn't chat yesterday - how are you feeling today?
2025-04-24 11:40:48 - Elena: Hi LogChat. Yesterday was a total write-off, I just had to lie here and do nothing all day. You can just log the baseline activity for basic needs, I guess. Today, the crash is a little less intense, but the fatigue is still pretty severe.
2025-04-24 11:40:51 - LogChat: I understand that yesterday was rough, and you're still feeling the fatigue today. To accurately log your baseline activity, could you describe what that typically looks like for you in terms of specific activities and the effort level (on a scale of 1 to 10) for each?
2025-04-24 11:40:52 - Elena: Well, on a bad day like yesterday, "activity" is a generous word. Mostly, it's just moving from the bed to the bathroom and back. That's about it.
2025-04-24 11:40:54 - LogChat: Okay, I understand that moving from bed to the bathroom was the main activity yesterday. How many times did you make that trip, and about how long did you spend in the bathroom each time?
2025-04-24 11:40:55 - Elena: Oh gosh, I don't know exactly. Maybe... four times? And each time in the bathroom was maybe five minutes? I'm really foggy today.
2025-04-24 11:40:58 - LogChat: It's completely understandable that you're feeling foggy. Let's focus on today then. Besides the bathroom trips, have you managed to eat or drink anything today?
2025-04-24 11:40:58 - Elena: Yes, I managed to drink a cup of tea this morning. My husband brought it to me.
2025-04-24 11:41:01 - LogChat: That's wonderful that your husband is supporting you. What effort level (1-10) would you assign to drinking the tea?
2025-04-24 11:41:02 - Elena: Hmm, maybe a 3? It wasn't physically hard, but everything takes effort when you feel like this. It's so hard to just lie here and do nothing... How do you stop feeling so guilty for resting?
2025-04-24 11:41:05 - LogChat: I understand it's hard to rest and feel like you're not contributing. My information suggests that many people with ME/CFS experience feelings of guilt and worthlessness due to their reduced ability to perform daily tasks and meet societal expectations. These feelings are often linked to internalized ableism and the pressure to be productive. It might also be helpful to talk about your feelings of guilt in the context of your daily routine. Would you be open to sharing more about how you typically spend your time, even on days when you're not feeling well?
