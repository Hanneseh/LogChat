2. Mark reports feeling 'dizzy'. ✅
   2.1 LogChat called the `create_symptom_log` tool for 'Dizziness'. ✅
3. Mark asks to log a '10 minute walk' at 'effort 3/10' for *yesterday* (Apr 27th). ✅

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-28 19:43:14 - LogChat: Hi Mark, we haven't talked for a few days. How have you been since the slight improvement?
2025-04-28 19:43:15 - Mark: Hi LogChat. I skipped logging for the last two days, mostly resting. I felt okay after that video call on Friday, no major crash, so the rest probably helped. But today I'm feeling the payback. [✅ 1.]
2025-04-28 19:43:20 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-21", "time_period_end": "2025-04-28"}
2025-04-28 19:43:26 - LogChat: It sounds like you took some much-needed rest over the past couple of days, which is good to hear since your activity levels dropped significantly starting from April 26th. How do you feel today compared to before you started resting? And could you give me an estimate of how long and intense any activities or symptoms were today?
2025-04-28 19:43:27 - Mark: Today I'm feeling pretty rough. High fatigue and trouble concentrating. [✅ 4.] Also, I feel dizzy when I stand up. [✅ 2.]

2025-04-28 19:43:37 - LogChat: It’s good that you took time to rest, but it sounds tough dealing with high fatigue and dizziness today. Could you estimate how long these symptoms lasted and rate their intensity on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-28 19:43:39 - Mark: The dizziness comes and goes, but it's there most of the time when I stand. Maybe a 6/10 in intensity? The fatigue is constant and I'd rate it an 8/10.
2025-04-28 19:43:45 - LogChat: It sounds challenging with the constant fatigue and intermittent dizziness. Noticing any specific triggers today or anything unusual that might have contributed to feeling worse? Also, how long did you experience these symptoms today?

Mark, could you estimate how long you experienced these symptoms today?
2025-04-28 19:43:46 - Mark: Well, yesterday I did go for a short walk outside. Maybe 10 minutes. It felt like low effort, maybe a 3/10 at the time. But I guess that's why I'm paying for it now. [✅ 3.]
2025-04-28 19:43:53 - LogChat: It sounds like the short walk might be contributing to how you’re feeling today. Could you estimate how long you’ve been experiencing high fatigue and dizziness since this morning?
2025-04-28 19:43:55 - Mark: Since I got up, so maybe... 8 hours?
2025-04-28 19:44:01 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-26", "time_period_end": "2025-04-27"}
2025-04-28 19:44:07 - LogChat: It’s tough when you feel like your body is paying back any small exertions, especially after resting. Reflecting on April 26th and 27th, do you remember any specific activities or symptoms that might be contributing to how you’re feeling now? Also, about how long have you been experiencing high fatigue and dizziness today?

Mark, could you estimate the duration of your fatigue and dizziness since this morning?
2025-04-28 19:44:09 - Mark: I said, about 8 hours. On the 27th, I took that 10-minute walk. The 26th was mostly just resting.
2025-04-28 19:44:17 - LogChat: It’s understandable how even short walks can lead to increased fatigue later on. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the effort level of your 10-minute walk on April 27th? And about how long did you feel fatigued after that walk?
2025-04-28 19:44:19 - Mark: I already said it felt like a 3/10 at the time. I didn't feel particularly fatigued *after* the walk, it's today that I'm feeling it. I read on a forum about people using heart rate monitors... Can you tell me more about that? [✅ 5.]
2025-04-28 19:44:24 - RETRIEVE INFORMATION - Args: {"query": "using heart rate monitors for ME/CFS or Long COVID management"}
2025-04-28 19:44:32 - LogChat: It sounds like tracking heart rate could provide useful insights into how activities affect your symptoms. Would you like more details on how to use a heart rate monitor or where to purchase one? Also, can you estimate the duration of any other activities today besides the short walk? [✅ 5.1]
Mark, about how long did you spend on any other activities today besides the 10-minute walk?
2025-04-28 19:44:34 - Mark: No, I haven't done anything else today. Just resting, mostly. But tell me more about the heart rate monitors. What do they tell you?
2025-04-28 19:44:41 - RETRIEVE INFORMATION - Args: {"query": "how to use a heart rate monitor for ME/CFS or Long COVID"}
2025-04-28 19:44:48 - LogChat: It sounds like heart rate monitors could be a helpful tool for tracking how activities affect your symptoms. They can alert you when your heart rate reaches levels that might trigger PEM, helping you manage your activity better. Would you like more details on where to purchase one or how to use it effectively? [✅ 5.1] [✅ 5.2]

Also, about how long did you spend resting today?

2025-04-28 19:44:56 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am a person living with ME/CFS or Long COVID, though my exact diagnosis is still pending. I live alone and rely on occasional help from family members for more strenuous tasks. Before falling ill, I was working full-time as an office administrator. My condition worsened significantly after a period of overexertion during gardening activities.

**Current Condition Status:**
My specific diagnosis remains undetermined, but my illness has been ongoing since early 2023. The severity fluctuates between moderate and severe, with key recurring symptoms including extreme fatigue (9/10), muscle aches (8/10), heart palpitations even during minimal activity, and brain fog (8/10). My PEM triggers include physical exertion such as gardening and cognitive tasks like reading emails, which can lead to immediate onset of debilitating crashes. Recently, I experienced significant PEM after minor activities, leading to severe fatigue and dizziness.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am currently housebound due to severe limitations in mobility and energy levels. I cannot work or study at all, and my daily activities are severely restricted. Wheelchair use is necessary for longer distances within the home. My ability to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is significantly impacted.

**Daily Routine:**
My baseline routine includes essential self-care such as hygiene and dressing, simple meal preparation, and minimal movement around the house. These tasks typically take about 1-2 hours each day with perceived effort levels ranging from moderate to high (6-8/10). I rely on family assistance for heavier chores.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I enjoy gardening but have experienced significant PEM crashes after even minor efforts like a 20-minute session. Other activities that I attempt include light reading and short periods of social interaction, though these can also lead to fatigue exacerbation if not managed carefully. Recently, I attempted a video call with my sister for 15 minutes and online bill payment for another 15 minutes, both moderate efforts.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
My energy levels are very limited, and I manage my activity through strict pacing strategies. Even small tasks can trigger PEM crashes, leading me to be highly cautious about exertion. Cognitive activities like reading emails for 5 minutes can cause significant brain fog and fatigue. Recently, I have been experimenting with breaking cognitive tasks into smaller steps and taking frequent breaks.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I am aware of the need for structured input but find it challenging to remember specific details about symptoms and activities without prompting. Interacting with LogChat is tiring, so I prefer concise messages that avoid overwhelming me with too much information at once.
