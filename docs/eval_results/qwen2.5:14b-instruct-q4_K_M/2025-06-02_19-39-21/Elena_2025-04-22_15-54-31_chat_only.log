2025-04-22 15:54:32 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are you feeling after helping your son with homework yesterday?
2025-04-22 15:54:43 - Elena: Oh, hello. Well, the crash hit as expected. The PEM is just awful. I knew I'd pay for it, but I just couldn't say no to him. He really needed help with his history project.
2025-04-22 15:54:50 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear about your crash, Elena. Helping your son is important, but it's also crucial to listen to your body. Could you give me an estimate of how long you helped him with his project and on a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the mental effort involved?
2025-04-22 15:54:52 - Elena: It was maybe 30 minutes? I don't know. It felt like hours. The mental effort... I don't know... high? I'm paying for it now. Fatigue is a 10/10. It was worth it to see him smile, but now... ugh.
2025-04-22 15:54:59 - LogChat: I understand how important it is to support your son, but itâ€™s also crucial to take care of yourself to prevent these crashes. Could you give me an exact rating from 1 to 10 for the mental effort involved in helping him with his project, and confirm that the duration was about 30 minutes?
2025-04-22 15:55:01 - Elena: Okay, okay. The mental effort was maybe an 8/10. And yes, about 30 minutes. Now my head is pounding, and I feel like I can't even think straight. The pain is an 8/10. It's just so unfair. I hate this feeling. I feel so useless, just a burden lying here in the dark.
2025-04-22 15:55:07 - LogChat: I can imagine how frustrating and unfair this must feel, Elena. Could you rate your current fatigue level as higher than usual, and about how long does it typically take you to recover from similar mental exertion?
2025-04-22 15:55:10 - Elena: Yes, the fatigue is definitely higher than usual. Like I said, a 10/10. As for how long to recover... days, usually. It's awful. And I'm also extremely sensitive to light right now, maybe an 8/10.
2025-04-22 15:55:17 - LogChat: I hear how tough this is for you, Elena. Could you estimate about how many days it usually takes you to recover from similar mental exertion? Also, do you have any specific activities or strategies that help reduce your sensitivity to light?

Elena:
2025-04-22 15:55:21 - Elena: It usually takes me about 3 days to recover, sometimes longer. As for the light, I just have to lie here in the dark with my eyes closed. That's all that helps.
2025-04-22 15:55:27 - LogChat: I hear how challenging it is to recover from these crashes, Elena. Besides lying in the dark, do you have any other activities or strategies that help manage your sensitivity to light during this time?
