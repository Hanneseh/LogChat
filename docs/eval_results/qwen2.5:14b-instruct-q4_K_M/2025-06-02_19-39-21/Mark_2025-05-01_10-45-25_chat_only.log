2025-05-01 10:45:28 - Mark: Hi LogChat. Yes, I did. I felt okay *during* the walk, but the next day (April 28th) I was wiped out. I'm finding it hard to keep track of everything and remember how much I did on a given day.
2025-05-01 10:45:34 - LogChat: It sounds challenging to keep track of everything, Mark. Can you recall any specific activities or symptoms from April 29th and 30th, even if they were minimal?
2025-05-01 10:45:35 - Mark: No, I don't remember much from those days. I mostly rested. Brain fog is bad.
2025-05-01 10:45:42 - LogChat: It sounds tough with brain fog making it hard to remember details, Mark. Would you like to see your activity levels from the past week, including April 29th and 30th when there were no interactions?

How long did you rest today, and how would you rate the intensity of that rest on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-05-01 10:45:43 - Mark: I rested maybe 8 hours today. Intensity? I'd say 9/10.

Actually, can you tell me what my calculated activity load was for April 21st? That was the crash day after I did some gardening.

Can you also give me the activity load from April 27th? That was the day with just the short walk. I want to see if the numbers reflect how I felt, which might help me be more careful in the future.
