**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-24 22:48:43 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, we haven't talked in a few days. How have you been feeling with the Low-Dose Naltrexone?
2025-04-24 22:48:44 - Sarah: Mostly resting these past couple of days, the 23rd and 24th. Symptoms stable, fatigue and brain fog both at 5/10. Today I took my first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed. [✅ 2.] [✅ 4.]
2025-04-24 22:48:50 - LogChat: It’s good to hear that your symptoms have been stable at 5/10 for fatigue and brain fog. How do you feel after taking the Low-Dose Naltrexone today? Have you noticed any immediate changes or effects? [✅ 2.1]

How would you rate the intensity of those symptoms on a scale from 1 to 10 right now, since taking the LDN?
2025-04-24 22:48:51 - Sarah: No change in fatigue or brain fog since taking the LDN, still 5/10. But I did have vivid dreams last night, severity 4/10. Otherwise, activities and symptoms consistent with my baseline. [✅ 3.]

2025-04-24 22:49:03 - LogChat: It sounds like you’re maintaining a consistent baseline with your symptoms at 5/10 for fatigue and brain fog, and no immediate changes from taking LDN today. Can you tell me about any specific activities or rest periods you had on the 23rd and 24th? And how would you rate the intensity of those days’ symptoms?
2025-04-24 22:49:04 - Sarah: Mostly resting on both the 23rd and 24th. No significant activities besides my baseline routine. Fatigue and brain fog were 5/10 on both days. [✅ 4.]
2025-04-24 22:49:13 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-23", "time_period_end": "2025-04-24"}

2025-04-24 22:49:25 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am a person living with ME/CFS or Long COVID, though my exact diagnosis is still pending. I live alone and rely on occasional support from family members for grocery shopping and minor household tasks. Before falling ill, I worked as a software developer. My symptoms started gradually after a viral infection.

**Current Condition Status:**
My specific diagnosis remains undetermined, but I have been experiencing ME/CFS or Long COVID symptoms for over two years now. The typical severity of my condition is moderate to severe, with fluctuating periods. Key recurring symptoms include brain fog (5/10) and fatigue (5/10). Physical exertion, cognitive tasks, emotional stress, and sensory overload are known PEM triggers. My PEM onset timing varies but often occurs within a few hours after triggering activities.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am housebound due to severe physical limitations. I cannot work full-time or study, though I manage part-time remote work with significant pacing. Mobility is limited; I use a wheelchair for longer distances and rely on assistance for tasks that require standing or walking for extended periods. My condition impacts my Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) significantly.

**Daily Routine:**
My baseline routine includes essential self-care activities such as hygiene and dressing, which take about 15 minutes each with an effort rating of 3/10. I prepare simple meals like breakfast, taking around 10 minutes with a perceived effort of 3/10. These tasks are completed while sitting to conserve energy.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I enjoy engaging in remote work and light meal preparation. However, these activities require careful pacing due to the risk of PEM onset. I have not attempted any new activities recently but am interested in exploring low-impact hobbies that do not exacerbate my symptoms.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
I manage my activity levels through strict pacing, avoiding push-crash cycles as much as possible. My energy is limited, and I need to balance rest with necessary tasks to prevent PEM episodes.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I am motivated to use LogChat to track symptoms and activities accurately but find it challenging to remember specific details without prompting. Interacting with the app can be tiring for me, so short and concise messages are preferred to avoid overwhelming my cognitive load.

**Additional Notes from Recent Summaries:**
- I started taking Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed. [✅ 2.2]
- My symptoms remain stable at a moderate level of severity, with no significant changes observed since starting the LDN treatment. Vivid dreams have been noted after taking LDN but without noticeable changes in other symptoms. [✅ 2.2]
- On days when I take LDN, my routine involves mostly resting and maintaining baseline activities to monitor any potential effects of the medication on my condition.
