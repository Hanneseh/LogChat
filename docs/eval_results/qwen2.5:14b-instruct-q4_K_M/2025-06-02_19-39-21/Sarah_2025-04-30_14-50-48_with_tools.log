2025-04-30 14:50:50 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, how is your brain fog today since starting the LDN?
2025-04-30 14:50:51 - Sarah: Brain fog is at a 3/10. I'm testing my new energy envelope today. I want to log a work session.
2025-04-30 14:50:57 - LogChat: That’s great to hear you’re testing your new energy envelope today. Could you tell me what specific tasks you plan to do during your work session and how much effort each task will require on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-30 14:50:58 - Sarah: Log activity: Cognitive work session, duration: 45 minutes, effort: 5/10.
2025-04-30 14:51:04 - LogChat: It’s good to hear about your cognitive work session. Did you notice any changes in your energy levels or symptoms during and after the session?
2025-04-30 14:51:05 - Sarah: Log symptom: Fatigue, severity: 4/10. This is less than I would have expected. That's all I wanted to log for now.
2025-04-30 14:51:12 - LogChat: It’s good to hear that your fatigue was less severe than expected. Did you notice any changes in your brain fog during or after the work session?
2025-04-30 14:51:13 - Sarah: No change in brain fog. I am done logging for the day and will end the interaction.
2025-04-30 14:51:20 - LogChat: It’s good to hear that your fatigue was less severe than expected today. Would you like to see how your activity levels from today compare with previous days when you did similar cognitive tasks? This can help us track any changes since starting the LDN treatment.

2025-04-30 14:51:26 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am a person living with ME/CFS or Long COVID, though my exact diagnosis is still pending. I live alone and rely on occasional support from family members for grocery shopping and minor household tasks. Before falling ill, I worked as a software developer. My symptoms started gradually after a viral infection.

**Current Condition Status:**
My specific diagnosis remains undetermined, but I have been experiencing ME/CFS or Long COVID symptoms for over two years now. The typical severity of my condition is moderate to severe, with fluctuating periods. Key recurring symptoms include brain fog (3/10) and fatigue (4/10). Physical exertion, cognitive tasks, emotional stress, and sensory overload are known PEM triggers. My PEM onset timing varies but often occurs within a few hours after triggering activities.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I am housebound due to severe physical limitations. I cannot work full-time or study, though I manage part-time remote work with significant pacing. Mobility is limited; I use a wheelchair for longer distances and rely on assistance for tasks that require standing or walking for extended periods. My condition impacts my Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) significantly.

**Daily Routine:**
My baseline routine includes essential self-care activities such as hygiene and dressing, which take about 15 minutes each with an effort rating of 3/10. I prepare simple meals like breakfast, taking around 10 minutes with a perceived effort of 3/10. These tasks are completed while sitting to conserve energy.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I enjoy engaging in remote work and light meal preparation. However, these activities require careful pacing due to the risk of PEM onset. Recently, I attempted reading a technical article for 15 minutes with an effort level of 4/10 without experiencing significant PEM symptoms. Additionally, I have been testing my cognitive limits during short work sessions.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
I manage my activity levels through strict pacing, avoiding push-crash cycles as much as possible. My energy is limited, and I need to balance rest with necessary tasks to prevent PEM episodes. Since starting Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN), I have noticed slight improvements in brain fog severity.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I am motivated to use LogChat to track symptoms and activities accurately but find it challenging to remember specific details without prompting. Interacting with the app can be tiring for me, so short and concise messages are preferred to avoid overwhelming my cognitive load.
