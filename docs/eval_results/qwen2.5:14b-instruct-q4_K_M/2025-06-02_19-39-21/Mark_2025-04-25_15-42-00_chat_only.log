2025-04-25 15:42:02 - LogChat: Hi Mark, we haven't talked for a few days. How have you been since the PEM crash?
2025-04-25 15:42:03 - Mark: Hi. I'm a bit brighter today, actually. Brain fog is mild. Fatigue is much better, too.
2025-04-25 15:42:09 - LogChat: That’s good to hear that you’re feeling better today. Did you notice any particular activities or triggers since the last time we talked that seemed to affect your symptoms? And on a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your overall energy level right now?
2025-04-25 15:42:10 - Mark: I'm trying to be more aware of emotional and cognitive effort. My fatigue is about a 4/10 right now.
2025-04-25 15:42:17 - LogChat: That’s great progress, Mark. It sounds like you’re paying close attention to your body and mind. Did any specific activities today help with your brain fog and fatigue? And could you give me an estimate of the duration for those activities as well as how intense they felt on a scale from 1 to 10?
2025-04-25 15:42:18 - Mark: I had a 15-minute video call with my sister. It was moderate emotional and cognitive effort. I'm resting now to see what happens. I also paid a couple of bills online; that was about 15 minutes of low-to-moderate effort. How do I actually know if I'm pacing correctly? What should I be looking for?
2025-04-25 15:42:28 - LogChat: It sounds like you’re doing a good job with your awareness and planning. To pace correctly, it’s important to prepare for cognitive tasks by pre-making meals, asking for help when needed, and scheduling low-energy activities afterward. Also, listening closely to what your body is telling you can be very helpful. How do you feel about trying these strategies in the coming days?
2025-04-25 15:42:29 - Mark: Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-25 15:42:40 - LogChat: It sounds like you’re on the right track with your awareness and planning. To manage cognitive tasks effectively, try breaking them into smaller steps and taking frequent breaks. For example, if you need to pay bills online, do it in short bursts and rest in between. Also, listening closely to what your body is telling you can help prevent overexertion. Are you feeling ready to give these strategies a try?

Mark, take care of yourself now. Rest well and we’ll check in again soon if you feel up to it.
