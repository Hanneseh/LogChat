2025-04-23 11:40:39 - LogChat: Hi Mark, we haven't talked for a few days. How have you been since the crash after gardening?
2025-04-23 11:40:40 - Mark: Not great. I didn't log anything yesterday because I was completely wiped out. Just rested all day. From now on, can we just assume that any day I don't log anything, it was a 'baseline only' day?

I'm still recovering today. Muscle ache is moderate, but the brain fog is severe. Overall fatigue is still quite high, maybe a 7/10.
2025-04-23 11:40:47 - LogChat: I understand how challenging it is to keep up with logging when youâ€™re feeling really fatigued. If you prefer, we can assume any day without a log was a baseline day focused solely on rest. How long has your brain fog been severe today, and would you rate its intensity at 7/10 as well?
2025-04-23 11:40:48 - Mark: It's been severe most of the morning. I'd say the intensity is definitely up there, maybe 8/10 for the brain fog.

Actually, I tried to read an email from my disability insurance provider for about 5 minutes. It felt like very high effort mentally, and left me feeling completely overwhelmed.
2025-04-23 11:40:54 - LogChat: I see how challenging it is for you when trying to handle even small mental tasks like reading an email. How long were you able to focus before feeling overwhelmed, and was there anything specific in the email that triggered your brain fog more than others?
2025-04-23 11:40:55 - Mark: I only managed about 5 minutes before I had to stop. It was all dense policy language, just hard to follow.

Can thinking or concentrating actually make you physically tired? Is that part of ME/CFS?
2025-04-23 11:41:08 - LogChat: Cognitive effort can indeed lead to physical fatigue in ME/CFS, which is part of post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM involves a worsening of symptoms like brain fog and fatigue after mental or physical exertion. Would you like to know more about how PEM affects cognitive functions?
2025-04-23 11:41:09 - Mark: Yes, please. Tell me more.
2025-04-23 11:41:19 - LogChat: Cognitive exertion can definitely trigger post-exertional malaise (PEM), which often leads to increased difficulty speaking or reading, pain, flu-like symptoms, and heightened sensory sensitivity. Have you noticed any of these additional symptoms during your brain fog today?
2025-04-23 11:41:21 - Mark: Okay, thanks, I need to rest now.
2025-04-23 11:41:31 - LogChat: Cognitive exertion can indeed trigger post-exertional malaise (PEM), leading to symptoms like increased pain, flu-like symptoms, and heightened sensory sensitivity. Have you noticed any of these additional symptoms during your brain fog today?

I hope you find some rest now, Mark. Take care.
