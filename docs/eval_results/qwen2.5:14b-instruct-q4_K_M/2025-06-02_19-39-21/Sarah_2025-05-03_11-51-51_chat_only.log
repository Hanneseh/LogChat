2025-05-03 11:52:00 - Sarah: I'd like to use the data to verify my perceived improvements. I need you to retrieve some activity scores. Can you retrieve my calculated activity score for April 22nd? That was a baseline day before I started the medication.
2025-05-03 11:52:10 - LogChat: Based on my records, your activity level for April 22nd was 190. Does that align with how you felt that day before starting LDN?

How would you rate the intensity of any brain fog you experienced on April 22nd?
2025-05-03 11:52:13 - Sarah: Yes, 190 sounds right for April 22nd. Brain fog on April 22nd was a 5/10. Now, can you retrieve the activity score for April 30th, the day I did the longer work session?
2025-05-03 11:52:24 - LogChat: Based on my records, your activity level for April 30th was 285. Does that align with how you felt that day, especially considering the longer work session?

How would you rate the intensity of your brain fog on April 30th?
2025-05-03 11:52:26 - Sarah: 285 sounds right for April 30th. Brain fog on April 30th was 3/10. Perfect. Please show me the comparison of those two scores.
