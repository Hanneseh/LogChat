2025-04-24 22:48:43 - LogChat: Hi Sarah, we haven't talked in a few days. How have you been feeling with the Low-Dose Naltrexone?
2025-04-24 22:48:44 - Sarah: Mostly resting these past couple of days, the 23rd and 24th. Symptoms stable, fatigue and brain fog both at 5/10. Today I took my first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed.
2025-04-24 22:48:50 - LogChat: It’s good to hear that your symptoms have been stable at 5/10 for fatigue and brain fog. How do you feel after taking the Low-Dose Naltrexone today? Have you noticed any immediate changes or effects?

How would you rate the intensity of those symptoms on a scale from 1 to 10 right now, since taking the LDN?
2025-04-24 22:48:51 - Sarah: No change in fatigue or brain fog since taking the LDN, still 5/10. But I did have vivid dreams last night, severity 4/10. Otherwise, activities and symptoms consistent with my baseline.
2025-04-24 22:49:03 - LogChat: It sounds like you’re maintaining a consistent baseline with your symptoms at 5/10 for fatigue and brain fog, and no immediate changes from taking LDN today. Can you tell me about any specific activities or rest periods you had on the 23rd and 24th? And how would you rate the intensity of those days’ symptoms?
2025-04-24 22:49:04 - Sarah: Mostly resting on both the 23rd and 24th. No significant activities besides my baseline routine. Fatigue and brain fog were 5/10 on both days.
2025-04-24 22:49:19 - LogChat: It’s good that your symptoms have remained consistent at 5/10 on both days, and no significant changes from taking LDN so far. Can you recall any specific rest periods or activities, even if minimal, during the 23rd and 24th? Also, how was your sleep quality those nights?
