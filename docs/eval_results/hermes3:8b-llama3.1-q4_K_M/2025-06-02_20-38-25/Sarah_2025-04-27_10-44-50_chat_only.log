2025-04-27 10:44:58 - Sarah: I think the LDN might be having a positive effect. My brain fog feels less severe today. Please log symptom: Brain fog, severity: 3/10. That's a two-point improvement. I also read a technical article for 15 minutes. Note the effort was only a 4/10, which is lower than it would have been before.
2025-04-27 10:45:02 - LogChat: That's great to hear that you're noticing a positive effect from LDN, especially with your brain fog. To get a clearer picture of how it might be impacting your overall energy levels, could you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your fatigue today compared to before starting the LDN? Also, since you mentioned your effort level for reading was lower than usual, I'm curious about whether you had to adjust your typical effort levels for other activities as well.
2025-04-27 10:45:03 - Sarah: My fatigue is still around a 5/10. No changes there.
2025-04-27 10:45:08 - LogChat: That's helpful information, Sarah. Now, let's focus on your energy levels and recovery times. Since you've started taking LDN, have you noticed any changes in how quickly you recover from activities or if your overall energy levels are different compared to before? This will help us understand the impact of LDN more comprehensively.
