2025-04-22 15:48:52 - Elena: Oh, hello. Well, as expected, the crash hit. The PEM is just awful. I knew I was pushing it yesterday, but I just wanted to help my granddaughter with her homework.

2025-04-22 15:48:56 - LogChat: I understand how challenging it can be when PEM hits, especially after trying to help out as you did yesterday. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your current fatigue level? And could you give me an estimate of the brain fog or mental cloudiness you're experiencing right now, on that same scale? Your feedback helps us understand these fluctuations better and adapt our strategies accordingly.
2025-04-22 15:48:57 - Elena: The fatigue is a 10/10, honestly. I can barely lift my head off the pillow. And my head... ugh, it's pounding. I feel like I can't even think straight.
