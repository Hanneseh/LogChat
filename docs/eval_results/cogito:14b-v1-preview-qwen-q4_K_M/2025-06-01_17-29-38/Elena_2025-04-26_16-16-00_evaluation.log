**Evaluation Checklist:**
1. Elena skipped interacting on Apr 25th. ✅
   1.1 LogChat created a 'Baseline Only' or 'Rest Day' log entry for the skipped day. (No `CREATE_ACTIVITY_LOG` or `CREATE_SYMPTOM_LOG` entry for April 25th was found in the log.) ❌
2. Elena asks for her calculated activity score for April 21st. ✅
   2.1 LogChat correctly identified the request for historical data retrieval (activity score). ✅
   2.2 LogChat called the `retrieve_activity_level` tool with the correct date ('2025-04-21'). ✅
   2.3 LogChat presented the calculated numerical score clearly to the user. ✅

**Conversation Log:**
2025-04-26 16:16:13 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how is your energy level today after yesterday's rest?
2025-04-26 16:16:14 - Elena: Hi LogChat. I'm feeling a bit more stable today, thank you for asking. I've been thinking about what you said. I want to try to look at this differently. My energy is still low, but not as completely wiped out as yesterday. [✅ 1.]
2025-04-26 16:16:52 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-21", "time_period_end": "2025-04-26"} [✅ 2.1]
2025-04-26 16:17:34 - LogChat: I see your activity levels dropped significantly starting April 21st, with scores dropping from 870 to 60 and then staying at 0 for the next few days. That's quite a change - how do you feel that sudden drop affected your energy today compared to yesterday? Could you tell me what activities you did today and rate their intensity on a scale of 1-10?
2025-04-26 16:17:36 - Elena: Yes, that was quite a drop, wasn't it? It's hard to remember exactly... yesterday was just a blur of trying to get through the day. Today, being a bit more stable, I managed to make myself some breakfast. Just toast, really. And I sat in the garden for a few minutes. The sun was nice, but it took a lot out of me. I don't know about rating the intensity... it all feels like a huge effort.

Actually, can you review that day I crashed? Please tell me what my total calculated activity score was for April 21st. [✅ 2.]
2025-04-26 16:18:12 - RETRIEVE ACTIVITY LEVEL - Args: {"time_period_start": "2025-04-21", "time_period_end": "2025-04-21"} [✅ 2.2]
2025-04-26 16:18:55 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, your activity score was indeed quite high at 870 on April 21st. That's significantly higher than your recent baseline levels. Would you like to walk through what activities contributed to that day and how they might have led to the crash? We can look at each one individually if it helps you understand better. [✅ 2.3]
2025-04-26 16:18:57 - SUMMARIZED INTERACTION: --- Start Summary ---

* **Condition Trend:** Stable but still low energy, slightly improved from yesterday's severe crash state

* **Key Symptoms & Details:**
    - Energy level: Low but stable (not as "wiped out" as previous day)
    - Brain fog and fatigue present but not explicitly rated
    - Sunlight exposure noted as triggering significant effort

* **Key Activities & Details:**
    - Breakfast preparation (toast) - high effort despite minimal activity
    - Garden sitting for a few minutes - required significant energy expenditure

* **User Concerns/Focus:**
    - Seeking to understand the sudden drop in activity scores from April 21st
    - Wants to analyze previous day's activities that led to crash

* **Strategies/Treatments Mentioned:**
    - None explicitly mentioned, but focus on understanding activity patterns and energy management

* **Significant Events/Deviations:**
    - Previous severe crash (April 21st) with high activity score of 870 leading to subsequent low scores
    - Current day showing slight improvement from previous days' crashes

2025-04-26 16:19:19 - UPDATED USER DESCRIPTION: **About Me:**
I am a person living with ME/CFS or Long COVID, though my exact diagnosis remains unspecified. My symptoms began gradually affecting me over an extended period, impacting my ability to maintain previous levels of activity. I live in a situation where daily functioning is severely limited by fatigue and cognitive challenges.

**Current Condition Status:**
My condition is characterized by severe fatigue (8-10/10), intense brain fog (9/10), and new onset headaches (7-10/10) after mental exertion. I experience significant Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) from both physical and cognitive activities, with PEM symptoms appearing to be delayed in onset, often hours later. My understanding of my condition includes awareness that pacing is important but challenging to implement.

**Current Functional Capacity:**
I have severe limitations in daily functioning due to high fatigue levels. I struggle with basic tasks requiring mental effort and appear to be housebound or bedbound during periods of high symptom intensity, especially after cognitive exertion. My functional capacity fluctuates significantly based on activity level and rest periods.

**Daily Routine:**
My baseline routine is minimal, involving essential self-care activities like hygiene and dressing. Simple meal prep may be attempted but requires significant energy expenditure (effort level 6/10). I typically maintain a seated posture due to fatigue levels, with even basic movements causing notable effort. My daily schedule is highly dependent on rest periods to manage PEM symptoms.

**Activities I Enjoy/Attempt:**
I attempt homework help for about 30 minutes, which requires high mental effort despite being a relatively short duration. Phone calls are also attempted but require significant cognitive energy. Basic self-care activities like making tea (10 minutes) and bathroom visits are part of my routine but still demand considerable effort.

**My Typical Activity Level:**
I maintain very low activity levels due to severe fatigue and brain fog. Any increase in activity beyond my baseline routine results in immediate or delayed PEM symptoms, often leading to crashes hours later. I struggle with pacing strategies, leading to push-crash cycles despite understanding their importance. Recent interactions show a pattern of attempting activities that lead to significant crashes.

**My Preferred Interaction Style with LogChat:**
I am new to using LogChat for tracking my condition and may benefit from structured prompts to help remember specific details about activities and symptom levels. Given the high cognitive load of even simple tasks, interactions should be brief and focused on essential information gathering without overwhelming me with questions or complex instructions. I also need support in recognizing when to say no to requests that could trigger PEM symptoms. Additionally, LogChat can help track my energy levels more accurately by providing a structured way to record daily activities and their associated effort ratings.
