2025-04-29 13:21:36 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are you feeling after the crash on April 26th?
2025-04-29 13:21:37 - Elena: Hi LogChat, it's good to hear from you. I'm doing a bit better, thank you for asking. I was only resting for the last two days, so I didn't log in. I just did my absolute baseline.
2025-04-29 13:22:51 - LogChat: I'm glad you're feeling a bit better after resting, Elena. Since you mentioned doing your baseline activities today, could you tell me what specific tasks you did and how intense each one felt on a scale of 1-10? This will help us track your recovery progress.
2025-04-29 13:22:52 - Elena: Well, I have a small victory to share. I've been strictly resting for the last two days, just my absolute baseline. And yesterday my husband asked for help with some paperwork, and for the first time, I said no without feeling awful about it.
2025-04-29 13:24:11 - LogChat: That's a significant step forward, Elena - being able to set boundaries without guilt is really important! Could you tell me what specific baseline activities you did today and how intense each one felt on a scale of 1-10? This will help us track your recovery progress.
2025-04-29 13:24:12 - Elena: Today, I mostly just stayed in bed. I got up to use the bathroom, of course, and I had a cup of tea. I'm not sure how to rate those, though. They're just... necessary.
2025-04-29 13:25:34 - LogChat: That's understandable, Elena - even basic tasks like using the bathroom or having a cup of tea can be quite draining when you're not feeling well. Could you give me an estimate on how much effort each of these activities took today? For example, would you rate getting up to use the bathroom as a 3 out of 10 in terms of energy expenditure?
2025-04-29 13:25:35 - Elena: Hmm, the bathroom is probably a 4. The tea... maybe a 5? It's hard to say. It all blurs together. But saying no to my husband yesterday... that felt HUGE. I remembered what that activity score looked like from the 21st, and I knew I just couldn't.
2025-04-29 13:27:00 - LogChat: Elena, that breakthrough of saying no without guilt sounds like a significant milestone in managing your boundaries. Could you tell me how yesterday's experience compared to previous times when you said yes - did it feel less draining or cause fewer symptoms?
2025-04-29 13:27:02 - Elena: It felt... empowering, actually. Usually, I'd feel so guilty and anxious afterward, but this time, I felt... relieved. Like I'd actually protected myself for once. It's hard to explain. Thank you for helping me see that. It really made a difference.
2025-04-29 13:28:29 - LogChat: Elena, it's great to see you recognizing the impact of high activity levels from April 21st when your score was 870 - that must have been quite draining! Could you tell me what specific activities contributed to that high score and how saying no yesterday compared to those days in terms of energy use?
