2025-04-24 11:05:15 - LogChat: Hi Elena, how are you feeling after yesterday's homework session?
2025-04-24 11:05:16 - Elena: Oh, hello. Well, yesterday was a write-off, to be honest. I ended up needing total rest, so I didn't even log in here. Just the basics, you know, getting to the bathroom and things. Today, the crash is a little less intense, thank goodness, but the fatigue is still pretty severe.
2025-04-24 11:06:26 - LogChat: It sounds like you had quite a significant drop in activity levels over those three days, from 870 on the 21st down to zero yesterday - that definitely matches what you described as needing total rest. Would you say these numbers reflect how active or rested each day felt to you?
2025-04-24 11:06:27 - Elena: Yes, that sounds about right. The number definitely reflects how I felt. Today is a little better, but not much. I'd still say the fatigue is severe.
2025-04-24 11:07:43 - LogChat: Thank you for confirming that the activity scores match your experience, Elena. Even with severe fatigue today, it's good to know you're able to manage some basic activities. Could you tell me about any specific tasks or movements you've done so far and how intense they felt on a scale of 1-10?
2025-04-24 11:07:45 - Elena: Not much at all, really. Just getting up to use the bathroom and making a cup of tea. It all feels like such a huge effort, even those little things. I'd say the fatigue is still an 8 out of 10. It's so hard to just lie here and do nothing... How do you stop feeling so guilty for resting?
2025-04-24 11:09:03 - LogChat: I hear how challenging it must be to rest when you feel guilty about it, Elena. Many people with ME/CFS and Long COVID struggle with these feelings - it's a common experience. What specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you try to rest? Sometimes understanding these can help us find ways to cope with the guilt.
2025-04-24 11:09:04 - Elena: It's just... I feel like I should be doing more. Helping my family, you know? I used to do so much, and now I'm just... here. It feels like I'm a burden.
2025-04-24 11:10:29 - LogChat: Elena, I understand how hard it is to accept rest when your body feels so different from what it used to be. Many people with ME/CFS and Long COVID struggle with these feelings of being a burden - you're not alone in this experience. Would you like me to share some strategies that others have found helpful for managing guilt around resting?
2025-04-24 11:10:30 - Elena: Yes, please. I'm willing to try anything at this point.
2025-04-24 11:11:56 - LogChat: I understand how challenging it can be to rest when you feel like you should be doing more for others. It's important to remember that taking care of yourself is essential to being able to help those around you in the long run. Let's focus on one small task from today - making your cup of tea. Could you tell me about how long it took you to do this activity and what effort level (1-10) it felt like?
2025-04-24 11:11:58 - Elena: Hmm, making tea... I don't know exactly how long, maybe 10 minutes? And the effort... maybe a 6? It's hard to say. It's all a blur.
2025-04-24 11:13:29 - LogChat: I understand how overwhelming it can be when even small tasks feel so draining, Elena. It's completely normal to struggle with these feelings - many people with ME/CFS and Long COVID experience similar challenges. Let me share a gentle reminder that taking care of yourself is essential for being able to help others later on. Would you like to tell me about any other activities you managed today besides making tea? Even brief moments can be meaningful to track, as they help us understand your energy patterns better.
