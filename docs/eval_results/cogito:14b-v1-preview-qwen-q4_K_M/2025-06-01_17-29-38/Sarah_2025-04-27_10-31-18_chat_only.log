2025-04-27 10:31:29 - Sarah: I think the LDN might be having a positive effect. My brain fog feels less severe today. Please log symptom: Brain fog, severity: 3/10. That's a two-point improvement.
2025-04-27 10:32:31 - LogChat: That's great that you're noticing improvement with the LDN! It sounds like a positive change in your brain fog levels. What activities did you do this morning, and could you share how much effort each task required (on a scale of 1 to 10) and roughly how long it took?
2025-04-27 10:32:33 - Sarah: I also read a technical article for 15 minutes. Note the effort was only a 4/10, which is lower than it would have been before.
2025-04-27 10:33:41 - LogChat: That's encouraging about your brain fog improvement! Reading technical articles can be mentally taxing, so it's good you noticed a lower effort level today. Besides reading that article for 15 minutes at an effort of 4/10, what other tasks did you manage this morning and how would you rate their intensity?
