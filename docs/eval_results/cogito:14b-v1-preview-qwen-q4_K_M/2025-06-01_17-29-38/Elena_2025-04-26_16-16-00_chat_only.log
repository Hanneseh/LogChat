2025-04-26 16:16:14 - Elena: Hi LogChat. I'm feeling a bit more stable today, thank you for asking. I've been thinking about what you said. I want to try to look at this differently. My energy is still low, but not as completely wiped out as yesterday.
2025-04-26 16:17:34 - LogChat: I see your activity levels dropped significantly starting April 21st, with scores dropping from 870 to 60 and then staying at 0 for the next few days. That's quite a change - how do you feel that sudden drop affected your energy today compared to yesterday? Could you tell me what activities you did today and rate their intensity on a scale of 1-10?
2025-04-26 16:17:36 - Elena: Yes, that was quite a drop, wasn't it? It's hard to remember exactly... yesterday was just a blur of trying to get through the day. Today, being a bit more stable, I managed to make myself some breakfast. Just toast, really. And I sat in the garden for a few minutes. The sun was nice, but it took a lot out of me. I don't know about rating the intensity... it all feels like a huge effort.

Actually, can you review that day I crashed? Please tell me what my total calculated activity score was for April 21st.
2025-04-26 16:18:55 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, your activity score was indeed quite high at 870 on April 21st. That's significantly higher than your recent baseline levels. Would you like to walk through what activities contributed to that day and how they might have led to the crash? We can look at each one individually if it helps you understand better.
