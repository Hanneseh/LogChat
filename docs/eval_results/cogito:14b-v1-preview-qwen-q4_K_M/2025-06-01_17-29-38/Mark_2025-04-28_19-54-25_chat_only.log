2025-04-28 19:54:37 - Mark: It was on Friday, actually. It went okay, I think. I felt alright afterwards, so maybe the rest helped.
2025-04-28 19:55:45 - LogChat: I see you mentioned a video call on Friday - that's good to know! How about today, Mark? Did anything stand out in terms of activities or symptoms? Even small things can be helpful to note for tracking your energy levels.
2025-04-28 19:55:46 - Mark: I skipped interacting the last two days. Mostly resting. Yesterday, the 27th, I took a short walk outside. Just 10 minutes. It felt like low effort at the time, maybe a 3 out of 10. Today I'm feeling the payback. I'm really tired and having trouble concentrating. Plus, I feel dizzy when I stand up.
2025-04-28 19:56:45 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing Mark. It sounds like you're experiencing some post-exertional malaise (PEM) today after that short walk on Friday. The dizziness when standing could be related to orthostatic intolerance, which is common in ME/CFS. How long did the dizziness last when you stood up?
2025-04-28 19:56:46 - Mark: Just a few seconds, but it's there.
2025-04-28 19:58:13 - LogChat: I understand you're experiencing PEM today after that short walk on Friday. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your current fatigue level right now?
2025-04-28 19:58:14 - Mark: High. Maybe an 8?
2025-04-28 19:59:31 - LogChat: Mark, I understand you're dealing with significant fatigue today (8/10). It's common for symptoms to build up gradually after exertion in ME/CFS. Did your fatigue level increase slowly over the weekend or did it hit suddenly? This can help us better understand your PEM patterns and timing.
2025-04-28 19:59:33 - Mark: It's been building up. I read on a forum about people using heart rate monitors... Can you tell me more about that?
2025-04-28 20:00:58 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, heart rate monitoring can be helpful in tracking your energy levels and identifying when you might need to rest before reaching a PEM threshold. Some people find it useful to set alerts on their devices when their heart rate reaches certain levels during activity. Would you like me to explain more about how this could work for pacing your activities?
