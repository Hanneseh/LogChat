2025-04-24 22:27:06 - Sarah: Brain fog 5/10. Fatigue 5/10. Same as yesterday. Mostly resting both days, no significant activities besides baseline.
2025-04-24 22:28:09 - LogChat: Thanks for sharing, Sarah. It sounds like you're managing a consistent baseline of fatigue and brain fog at around 5/10 each day. Could you tell me about your typical resting routine - how many hours do you usually spend resting or sleeping?
2025-04-24 22:28:10 - Sarah: Resting routine is variable, mostly lying down and listening to audiobooks. Hours vary. Today, took first dose of Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) as prescribed. Also, vivid dreams last night, severity: 4/10. Other activities and symptoms (fatigue, brain fog) consistent with baseline, unchanged.
2025-04-24 22:29:18 - LogChat: Based on my knowledge, rest is a crucial part of managing ME/CFS and Long COVID symptoms like fatigue and brain fog. It's interesting that you're noticing vivid dreams since starting LDN - some people report this as their body adjusts to the medication. Could you tell me how many hours you typically spend resting each day, and whether there are times when your rest feels more or less effective at managing your energy levels?
