2022-07-23 17:26:24 - John: Not great. Tired as usual.
2022-07-23 17:26:27 - LogChat: I'm sorry to hear that, John. On a scale from 1 to 10, where would you rate your fatigue today?
2022-07-23 17:26:27 - John: Like an 8. Maybe even a 9. It was hard to get groceries today.
2022-07-23 17:26:30 - LogChat: That sounds really challenging, John. Have you noticed any particular activities that seem to drain your energy more quickly than others?
2022-07-23 17:26:31 - John: Yeah, walking to the supermarket is always a killer. It's only 150m, but I have to rest afterwards. I went this morning. Got back around 11:30.
2022-07-23 17:26:35 - LogChat: Have you tried breaking up the trip to the supermarket, maybe by taking a short break halfway there or back?
2022-07-23 17:26:36 - John: I try not to stop. It feels like a failure when I do. But maybe I should.
2022-07-23 17:26:38 - LogChat: Have you experienced any other symptoms or challenges today, aside from fatigue?
2022-07-23 17:26:39 - John: Headache, like every day. And my eyes are a bit sensitive. It was sunny, and I forgot my sunglasses.
2022-07-23 17:26:42 - LogChat: Sometimes even small things like sunlight can be tough to handle. Do you have a favorite pair of sunglasses, or is there a type you find particularly helpful?
2022-07-23 17:26:43 - John: Just some cheap ones. Need to find them, I guess.
2022-07-23 17:26:45 - LogChat: Have you found any particular strategies or routines that help manage your fatigue or headaches, or is there something you'd like to try?
2022-07-23 17:26:47 - John: I usually just lie down and rest. Sometimes it helps. Today I had some fruit and a grilled cheese after the supermarket. That helped a little. I also spent some time googling Long Covid. That was tiring, too.
2022-07-23 17:26:50 - LogChat: It's great to hear that resting and having a snack helped a bit. Is there something you enjoy doing while you rest, like listening to music or a podcast, that might make it more relaxing for you?
2022-07-23 17:26:51 - John: Not really. Just trying to keep the thoughts away. The googling was mostly reading Reddit and news articles. Felt like I should know more.
2022-07-23 17:26:54 - LogChat: Have you noticed any emotional experiences or mood changes today that you'd like to discuss?
