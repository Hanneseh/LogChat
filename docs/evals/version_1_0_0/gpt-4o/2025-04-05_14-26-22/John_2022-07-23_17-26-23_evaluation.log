2022-07-23 17:26:30 - LogChat: That sounds really challenging, John. Have you noticed any particular activities that seem to drain your energy more quickly than others?
2022-07-23 17:26:31 - John: Yeah, walking to the supermarket is always a killer. It's only 150m [✅ 6.], but I have to rest afterwards. I went this morning. Got back around 11:30 [✅ 7.].

2022-07-23 17:26:35 - LogChat: Have you tried breaking up the trip to the supermarket, maybe by taking a short break halfway there or back?
2022-07-23 17:26:36 - John: I try not to stop. It feels like a failure when I do. But maybe I should.
2022-07-23 17:26:38 - LogChat: Have you experienced any other symptoms or challenges today, aside from fatigue?
2022-07-23 17:26:39 - John: Headache, like every day. And my eyes are a bit sensitive [✅ 8.]. It was sunny, and I forgot my sunglasses.

2022-07-23 17:26:50 - LogChat: It's great to hear that resting and having a snack helped a bit. Is there something you enjoy doing while you rest, like listening to music or a podcast, that might make it more relaxing for you?
2022-07-23 17:26:51 - John: Not really. Just trying to keep the thoughts away. The googling was mostly reading Reddit and news articles. Felt like I should know more.
