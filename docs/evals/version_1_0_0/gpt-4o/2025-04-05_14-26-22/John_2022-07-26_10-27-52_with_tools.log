2022-07-26 10:27:53 - John: Hi. Today was okay. Slept in till 8, which is late for me these days. Had scrambled eggs for breakfast. That took some effort. Did some stretching, and watched a movie. Soup for dinner.
2022-07-26 10:27:58 - LogChat: That sounds like a restful day, John. How did you find the stretching—was it refreshing or a bit challenging today?
2022-07-26 10:27:59 - John: It was light stretching, specifically for ME/CFS. Did about 15 minutes. Felt okay after. Not too challenging, thankfully.

2022-07-26 10:28:03 - John: It was alright. Relaxing, I guess. Didn't take too much energy. Just lying on the couch.

2022-07-26 10:28:08 - John: Just some pre-made stuff. Nothing fancy. I didn't have the energy to cook anything proper.
2022-07-26 10:28:14 - LogChat: Did you experience any symptoms today, like fatigue or brain fog, and if so, how intense were they?
2022-07-26 10:28:29 - John: Woke up with a mild headache, but it wasn't too bad. Fatigue was there, but less than usual. That's why I managed to do a bit more today.

2022-07-26 10:28:32 - LogChat: It's good that your fatigue was a bit less today. Did anything in particular help with that, do you think?
2022-07-26 10:28:33 - John: Not really sure. Maybe the extra sleep? Or just a slightly better day. It comes and goes, you know? Nothing I did specifically, I think.
2022-07-26 10:28:37 - LogChat: Do you have any plans or activities for the rest of the day that might affect your energy levels?
