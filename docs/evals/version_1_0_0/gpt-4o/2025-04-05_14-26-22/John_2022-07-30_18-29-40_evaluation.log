2022-07-30 18:29:49 - LogChat: I'm glad the warm bath provided some relief. Have you considered breaking up your tasks into smaller chunks to help manage your energy levels?
2022-07-30 18:29:50 - John: Yeah, I tried that today. Pacing [✅ 5.]. 10 minutes work, 5 minutes rest [✅ 5.]. It...sort of worked. Living room's tidy now. But I'm wiped.
2022-07-30 18:29:55 - LogChat: It's impressive that you gave pacing a try! How did you feel during your rest periods, and did you encounter any challenges with the pacing approach today?
2022-07-30 18:29:56 - John: Rest periods were good. Needed them. Challenge was... sticking to it. Wanted to just get it done, you know? But I stopped myself. Didn't want to crash completely.
2022-07-30 18:30:03 - LogChat: Did you notice any particular symptoms or changes during your rest periods that might give us a sense of how well the pacing strategy worked for you today?
2022-07-30 18:30:04 - John: Muscle ache was less during the rests. Fatigue... stayed about the same, maybe a little better after the bath. Woke up with moderate fatigue this morning [✅ 2.]. Slept 8.5 hours [✅ 1.], less than usual [✅ 1.].

2022-07-30 18:30:10 - LogChat: It sounds like you're doing your best to manage your energy, even on days when you wake up feeling more fatigued. Do you have any plans for how you might approach tomorrow, given how today went?
2022-07-30 18:30:11 - John: No plans. See how I feel. Maybe a short walk if the muscle aches aren't too bad. Just...rest, probably.
2022-07-30 18:30:18 - LogChat: Do you have any specific strategies in mind for managing your symptoms if you decide to go for a walk tomorrow?
2022-07-30 18:30:20 - John: Not really. Just... go slow. Turn back if I need to. It's just a short walk, nothing crazy. Had porridge and green tea for breakfast [✅ 3.]. Salad for lunch [✅ 6.]. Pasta and pesto for dinner [✅ 9.]. Just so you know.

2022-07-30 18:30:28 - LogChat: That sounds like a nutritious day! Going slow and turning back if needed are great ways to pace yourself on a walk. Is there anything in particular you enjoy about your walks?
2022-07-30 18:30:29 - John: Fresh air. Seeing some green. Anything else you need to know? I'm pretty tired.
2022-07-30 18:30:38 - LogChat: Fresh air and greenery can be so rejuvenating. Before you rest, is there any specific part of the day you'd like to reflect on or talk about a bit more?
