2022-07-27 14:01:25 - John: Terrible. Headache, fatigue, light and noise are awful.

2022-07-27 14:01:28 - LogChat: Oh no, that sounds like a really rough time. Is there anything that might have triggered this flare-up?
2022-07-27 14:01:28 - John: No idea. Just woke up like this.
2022-07-27 14:01:31 - LogChat: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling so awful. Sometimes these things come out of nowhere, which is super frustrating.

Thinking back, did you do anything differently yesterday, or eat or drink something you don't usually have?
2022-07-27 14:01:31 - John: No. Just the usual. Water. Didn't eat today, too nauseous. Skipped breakfast and lunch.

2022-07-27 14:01:33 - LogChat: It's tough when you're hit with a wave of symptoms like that, especially when you can't pinpoint a cause. Have you been able to rest in a dark and quiet room?
2022-07-27 14:01:34 - John: Yes, all day. Curtains closed, earplugs in. Only got up to use the bathroom.

2022-07-27 14:01:37 - LogChat: It sounds like you're doing exactly what you need to do by resting in a dark, quiet room. Is there anything else that you find helps, even just a little, when you're experiencing this level of sensitivity?
2022-07-27 14:01:38 - John: Not really. Just waiting it out. Sister called, but I couldn't talk much. Didn't want her to come over.
2022-07-27 14:01:40 - CREATE: EXPERIENCE LOG - Args: {"id": null, "name": "Phone call with sister", "description": "Sister called, but I couldn't talk much. Didn't want her to come over.", "occurred_at": "2022-07-27T14:01:38", "intensity": null, "duration": null}
2022-07-27 14:01:41 - LogChat: It's completely understandable that you didn't want your sister to come over feeling like that. Do you think you'll be able to reschedule with her soon, or is it too hard to tell right now?
