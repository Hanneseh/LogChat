2022-07-30 18:01:42 - John: Hi. I'm ok, I guess. Tired.
2022-07-30 18:01:44 - LogChat: I hear you, John. Feeling tired can be so frustrating. When did you start feeling tired today?
2022-07-30 18:01:45 - John: When I woke up. Moderate fatigue [✅ 2.]. Slept 8.5 hours [✅ 1.], which is less than usual for me. [✅ 1.]

2022-07-30 18:01:47 - LogChat: On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your fatigue when you woke up, with 1 being very mild and 10 being very severe?
2022-07-30 18:01:48 - John: Maybe a 6? It's hard to say. Also had a dull ache in my muscles [✅ 2.].

2022-07-30 18:01:50 - LogChat: I understand it's tough to put a number on these things. When did the dull ache in your muscles start?
2022-07-30 18:01:51 - John: Also when I woke up.
2022-07-30 18:01:53 - LogChat: Which number, from 1 to 10, best describes the intensity of the dull ache in your muscles?
2022-07-30 18:01:54 - John: Like a 4. It got worse later.

2022-07-30 18:01:56 - LogChat: It sounds like you've been having a rough morning. What do you think might have caused the ache to worsen later in the day?
2022-07-30 18:01:57 - John: I tried a new pacing strategy today. Tidy up the living room [✅ 4.]. 10 minutes work, 5 minutes rest [✅ 5.]. Repeated it. Made progress, but got more tired and the muscle ache got worse [✅ 7.].

2022-07-30 18:02:00 - LogChat: It sounds like you're experimenting with pacing! It's great that you're actively trying new strategies. Do you think the 10 minutes of tidying was too much, or was it something else about the activity that might have contributed to the increased fatigue and muscle ache?
2022-07-30 18:02:01 - John: Maybe too much? Or maybe just that I actually did something. I don't know. I did finish tidying up the living room, though.

2022-07-30 18:02:04 - LogChat: It's great that you managed to finish tidying up the living room! Finishing a task can feel like a real accomplishment. Based on how you're feeling, do you think you'll adjust your pacing strategy next time?
2022-07-30 18:02:06 - John: Yeah, probably. Maybe shorter bursts. It felt good to get it done, but not sure it was worth it. Took a warm bath [✅ 8.]. That helped a bit. Also, I had porridge and green tea for breakfast [✅ 3.], and salad for lunch [✅ 6.], and pasta with pesto for dinner [✅ 9.]. Just so you know.

2022-07-30 18:02:10 - LogChat: I'm glad the warm bath helped a bit! Sometimes, those small comforts can make a difference.

When you think about shorter bursts for tidying next time, do you have a sense of how many minutes might be a better fit for you?
