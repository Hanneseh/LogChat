2022-07-26 10:05:04 - John: Hi. I'm okay, I guess. A bit better than usual today.
2022-07-26 10:05:32 - LogChat: What do you think made you feel a bit better today, John?
2022-07-26 10:05:32 - John: I slept almost 10 hours, so that probably helped. And I managed to make myself some breakfast, scrambled eggs. That was nice.
2022-07-26 10:05:57 - LogChat: That's great, John! Sleep and proper nutrition can be really important for managing your symptoms. How did making scrambled eggs feel for you energy-wise? Did it take a lot out of you or was it manageable?
2022-07-26 10:05:58 - John: It took more effort than I thought it would. Had to take a few breaks while making it. But it was worth it.
2022-07-26 10:06:19 - LogChat: LogChat: Sounds like taking breaks during activities is important for you, John. Remember, pacing is all about managing your energy levels and not overexerting yourself. Would you like to hear more about how pacing can help with managing your condition?
2022-07-26 10:06:20 - John: Not really, I think I get the idea. I rested after breakfast for about an hour.
2022-07-26 10:06:40 - LogChat: That's really great that you took a break after breakfast, John! It's very important to listen to your body and take breaks when needed. Keep up the good work!
2022-07-26 10:06:41 - John: Thanks. I also did some light stretching exercises later. 15 minutes or so.
2022-07-26 10:07:07 - LogChat: LogChat: Oh, nice job! Stretching can be a great way to manage your symptoms and help with pain relief. Just make sure you don't overdo it and listen to your body. Did you notice any effects of post-exertional malaise after the stretching exercises?
2022-07-26 10:07:08 - John: Felt okay afterwards. Didn't push myself too hard.
2022-07-26 10:07:35 - LogChat: LogChat: It sounds like you had a good balance today, John! You were able to prepare breakfast and even do some light stretching exercises without pushing yourself too hard. Keep up the great work! Remember, pacing is all about finding that balance between activity and rest. How have you found it helpful in managing your symptoms so far?
2022-07-26 10:07:36 - John: Yeah, I think pacing helped a bit today. I also watched a movie later. And had some soup for dinner. That's about it.
