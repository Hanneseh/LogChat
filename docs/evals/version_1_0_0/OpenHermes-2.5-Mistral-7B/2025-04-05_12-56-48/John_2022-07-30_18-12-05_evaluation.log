2022-07-30 18:12:56 - LogChat: LogChat: Sounds like tidying up was quite an energy-consuming task for you today. How do you usually manage your energy levels when doing household tasks?
2022-07-30 18:12:57 - John: I'm trying out this new pacing strategy. Short bursts of activity, then rest. Worked okay today, I think. 10 minutes of work, 5 of rest [✅ 5.]. Repeated that a few times.
2022-07-30 18:13:16 - LogChat: Great job trying out pacing today! Remember, everyone's body is different, so it may take some trial and error to find the best strategy that works for you. Just make sure to listen to your body and rest when needed.
2022-07-30 18:13:17 - John: Yeah, I figured. I had porridge and green tea this morning [✅ 3.]. Salad for lunch [✅ 6.], pasta with pesto for dinner [✅ 9.]. Nothing special. Just trying to keep it simple.
2022-07-30 18:13:38 - LogChat: Great job on managing your energy levels today with pacing! Remember, it's normal to have good and bad days as you find what works best for you.
