2022-07-26 10:21:16 - John: Not sure really. Slept almost 10 hours. Maybe that helped.

2022-07-26 10:21:26 - LogChat: I'm glad you got some rest. Did you end up doing anything productive today despite feeling relatively better, or did you take it easy?
2022-07-26 10:21:26 - John: I made myself breakfast. Scrambled eggs. And did some stretching. Nothing major. Watched a movie too.

2022-07-26 10:21:37 - LogChat: That sounds like a nice relaxing morning. What kind of stretching did you do, was it more intense than usual or just a gentle stretch?
2022-07-26 10:21:38 - John: Just some light stretching exercises I found online. For ME/CFS. Only 15 minutes.

2022-07-26 10:21:50 - LogChat: It sounds like you're being mindful of your energy levels and taking it easy, which is a great approach for managing ME/CFS. One thing I've found helpful is to listen to my body and adjust activities based on how I feel. Do you find that since you started taking it easy today, your fatigue level has been consistent or is it decreasing gradually?
