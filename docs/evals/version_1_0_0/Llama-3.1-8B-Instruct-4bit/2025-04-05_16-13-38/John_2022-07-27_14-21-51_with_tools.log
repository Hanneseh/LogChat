2022-07-27 14:22:14 - John: I've been on sick leave for two weeks now. This has been going on since May, but it's getting worse. I can't do anything when it's this bad. Can't even look at my phone.
2022-07-27 14:22:33 - LogChat: Do you have any hobbies or activities that bring you joy and help take your mind off things, but you haven't been able to do them lately due to your symptoms?

2022-07-27 14:22:52 - LogChat: I'm sorry you're having such a tough day. It sounds like even the smallest bits of sensory input can be overwhelming for you right now.
2022-07-27 14:22:53 - John: Yeah. It is. I couldn't even eat anything today. Too nauseous. Just water. My sister called, but I could barely talk.
2022-07-27 14:24:08 - LogChat: How are you feeling emotionally right now, John? Is it just the physical symptoms you're dealing with, or is there something else bothering you too?
