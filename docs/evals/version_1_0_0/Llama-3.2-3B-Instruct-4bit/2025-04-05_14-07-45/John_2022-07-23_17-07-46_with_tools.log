2022-07-23 17:07:47 - John: Not great. Tired as usual.

2022-07-23 17:07:52 - LogChat: Do you find that your energy levels have been consistent throughout the day today, or are they fluctuating?
2022-07-23 17:07:52 - John: Fluctuating. Was ok-ish this morning after waking up, but the grocery shopping wiped me out.

2022-07-23 17:07:57 - LogChat: Is your grocery shopping typically a low-energy activity for you, or is this unusual?
2022-07-23 17:07:57 - John: It's never fun, but today was particularly bad. Maybe because it was sunny and I forgot my sunglasses.

2022-07-23 17:08:02 - LogChat: That sunny day can be overwhelming for some people. Did you experience any other symptoms besides tiredness after the grocery shopping, such as pain or brain fog?
2022-07-23 17:08:03 - John: Yeah, headache got worse. And the brain fog is always there, just kinda amplified today.
2022-07-23 17:08:08 - LogChat: How are your headaches being managed today, aside from the exacerbation after grocery shopping?
2022-07-23 17:08:08 - John: I don't really do anything for them. Just try to rest. Painkillers don't really help.

2022-07-23 17:08:13 - LogChat: Are you finding it hard to make a plan for tomorrow, knowing the grocery shopping might be challenging again?
2022-07-23 17:08:14 - John: I don't want to think about tomorrow. Just gonna chill for the rest of the day and maybe watch some TV.

2022-07-23 17:08:19 - LogChat: Are you feeling overwhelmed or struggling to come up with energy for tomorrow, now that the grocery shopping might be challenging again?
2022-07-23 17:08:20 - John: Yeah, kinda dreading it. Maybe I'll order something online. Less exhausting.

2022-07-23 17:08:25 - LogChat: Are you finding it helpful to take breaks and rest when your energy levels are low, or do you feel like you're falling behind on tasks because of this?
2022-07-23 17:08:27 - John: I have to rest. Otherwise, I can't do anything at all. So yeah, it helps, but it also sucks because I can't get anything done.
2022-07-23 17:08:32 - LogChat: Does taking a short break right now, just to sit comfortably and relax for 10-15 minutes, help you recharge a bit before we continue talking?
2022-07-23 17:08:34 - John: I'm already resting. Been on the couch for hours. But yeah, I guess I could close my eyes for a bit.
2022-07-23 17:08:39 - LogChat: Do you find that taking breaks like this, resting on the couch and closing your eyes for a bit, actually help you recharge or do they feel like a waste of time?
2022-07-23 17:08:41 - John: They help a bit. It's not like I'm suddenly full of energy, but it takes the edge off. Lets me do a little bit more before crashing again.
2022-07-23 17:08:47 - LogChat: Are you finding it challenging to prioritize self-care activities amidst your daily tasks and energy limitations?
2022-07-23 17:08:48 - John: What else am I gonna do? I'm on sick leave. Self-care is pretty much all I can do right now. Still doesn't make me feel better.
2022-07-23 17:08:54 - LogChat: Does it help to acknowledge and validate your feelings about managing energy levels, rather than focusing on doing more or accomplishing tasks?
2022-07-23 17:08:55 - John: I guess so. It's just frustrating, you know? I want to do stuff, but my body won't let me. Acknowledging that doesn't really change anything.
2022-07-23 17:09:02 - LogChat: Do you feel like you're running on empty, or is there a specific reason you're feeling particularly drained today?
2022-07-23 17:09:03 - John: Grocery shopping and being in the sun without sunglasses probably didn't help. Plus, I was googling Long Covid stuff, which is surprisingly exhausting.

2022-07-23 17:09:10 - LogChat: You've been going overboard today. What do you think would happen if you stopped everything right now and did nothing for a while?
