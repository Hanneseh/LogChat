2022-07-27 14:11:07 - LogChat: Hi John! How are you?
2022-07-27 14:11:07 - John: Terrible. Headache, fatigue, light and noise make it unbearable.
2022-07-27 14:11:12 - LogChat: How are your light and noise sensitivities doing today?
2022-07-27 14:11:12 - John: Awful. Had to close the curtains and use earplugs all day.
2022-07-27 14:11:17 - LogChat: How are you managing your energy levels today? Are you feeling like taking a break soon, or waiting it out for now?
2022-07-27 14:11:17 - John: I've been in bed all day. No energy to do anything.
2022-07-27 14:11:22 - LogChat: Are dark and quiet spaces comfortable for you at the moment, or do light and noise triggers make it hard to relax?
2022-07-27 14:11:23 - John: Dark and quiet is the only way I can cope right now.
2022-07-27 14:11:27 - LogChat: How's your sleep been tonight, John?
2022-07-27 14:11:28 - John: I slept all day, but I don't feel rested. Still exhausted.
2022-07-27 14:11:32 - LogChat: Is it hard for you to admit when you've reached your limits and need to take a break?
2022-07-27 14:11:33 - John: Yes, it is. I don't want to be a burden. My sister offered to come over, but I said no.
2022-07-27 14:11:38 - LogChat: Are you feeling like your symptoms are related to something specific that happened today, or is it more of a general pattern you're experiencing?
2022-07-27 14:11:39 - John: It's been getting worse since May. Doctors don't take me seriously. I'm on sick leave. Burnout, they say, but it's more than that. Long Covid, I think.
2022-07-27 14:11:44 - LogChat: Is it hard for you to ask a friend or family member for help when you're feeling overwhelmed and unable to take care of yourself, given your feelings about not being a burden?
2022-07-27 14:11:46 - John: Yeah, it is. They're busy. I don't know how they could help anyway. I skipped breakfast and lunch. Could barely drink water. Voice was weak when my sister called.
2022-07-27 14:11:51 - LogChat: Do you find that your environment, or the way it's being presented to you (e.g., light and noise levels), is triggering your symptoms, or is it more of a reflection of what's going on internally that's causing the discomfort?
2022-07-27 14:11:52 - John: The light and noise make the headache and fatigue worse, but I think it's mostly internal. I felt awful when I woke up.
2022-07-27 14:11:58 - LogChat: You've been experiencing a lot of pain and discomfort today, haven't you?
