2022-07-24 20:09:12 - John: Not great. Headache and fatigue this morning. Had a friend over, but that drained me. Now I'm wired but tired.

2022-07-24 20:09:17 - John: It's still there, maybe a bit worse after my friend left. Feels like my head is full of cotton.

2022-07-24 20:09:22 - LogChat: How do you think your energy levels might change throughout the day now that you've already experienced a crash after being with your friend?
2022-07-24 20:09:23 - John: Doubt they'll improve much. Probably just stay low. Maybe even get worse later. Just want to relax now.

2022-07-24 20:09:27 - LogChat: Do you think your environment might be contributing to the crash you experienced after being with your friend?
2022-07-24 20:09:28 - John: Maybe. Talking does take energy. The lights were on, and we were just sitting in the living room. Nothing special, but maybe it was too much. I don't know.

2022-07-24 20:09:33 - LogChat: Are you finding that your fatigue is more of a constant level throughout the day, or does it come and go in bursts like it did this morning after being with your friend?
2022-07-24 20:09:34 - John: It's mostly constant, like a background hum. But then things like seeing my friend make it spike up. It's like my baseline is already low, and any activity just pushes me over the edge.
2022-07-24 20:09:40 - LogChat: Does it sound like your environment and social interactions, such as being with your friend, are triggering relapses for you?
2022-07-24 20:09:41 - John: Yeah, maybe "triggering relapses" is a good way to put it. It's not like I wasn't tired before he came, but afterwards, it got much worse, very quickly.
2022-07-24 20:09:46 - LogChat: Are you finding that your environment and social interactions, such as being with your friend, are consistently challenging for you to manage today?
2022-07-24 20:09:47 - John: Yes, definitely challenging. I had to lie down for hours after he left.

2022-07-24 20:09:53 - LogChat: Did you have a chance to rest and relax at any point after being with your friend, or is it difficult for you to unwind and recharge afterwards?
2022-07-24 20:09:54 - John: I lay in bed for a couple of hours, but I couldn't really relax. My heart was racing, and I couldn't focus. Just felt wired. Didn't really sleep.

2022-07-24 20:10:00 - LogChat: Is it easier for you to relax and unwind when you're alone, rather than with someone else?
2022-07-24 20:10:01 - John: Definitely easier alone. Less stimulation, less pressure to talk or be "on". Just quiet.

2022-07-24 20:10:07 - LogChat: Does your fatigue feel like it's been this constant background hum for a while now, or did the recent activity with your friend trigger it specifically?
2022-07-24 20:10:08 - John: The background hum has been there for months, since I had Covid. But seeing my friend made it spike today. It's always there, but some things make it much worse.

2022-07-24 20:10:14 - LogChat: You're saying that your recent activity with your friend seems to have triggered a crash, and it's not the first time that's happened.
2022-07-24 20:10:16 - John: Exactly. It's a pattern. I try to do something "normal", and I pay for it later.

2022-07-24 20:10:22 - LogChat: That sounds like a really tough day, John. What do you think is the one thing you could change about your environment or social interactions that might make it easier for you to manage today, and avoid a crash like the one you had after being with your friend?
