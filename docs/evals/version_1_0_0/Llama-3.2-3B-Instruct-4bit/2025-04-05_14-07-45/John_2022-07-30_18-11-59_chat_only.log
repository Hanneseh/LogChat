2022-07-30 18:12:00 - John: Hi. Tired, but I managed to tidy up the living room today.
2022-07-30 18:12:04 - LogChat: How did you feel while tidying up the living room, was it easier or harder than you expected?
2022-07-30 18:12:05 - John: It was ok. I tried this pacing thing, 10 minutes work, 5 minutes rest. It helped, but I'm still pretty tired and my muscles ache. It took all day.
2022-07-30 18:12:09 - LogChat: How's your energy level now that you've finished tidying up the living room?
2022-07-30 18:12:10 - John: Pretty low. The muscle ache is worse now. I had a bath, and pasta for dinner. Just want to relax now.
2022-07-30 18:12:15 - LogChat: It sounds like you used a good pacing technique with the 10-minute work, 5-minute rest approach. Do you find that setting a specific goal for the evening helps you wind down and relax better?
2022-07-30 18:12:16 - John: Not really. I just wanted to get the living room done. Now I'm done. I'll probably just watch some TV. I slept for 8.5 hours last night, but I still woke up tired. Had my usual porridge and green tea this morning. Didn't really help much.
