2022-07-30 18:12:05 - John: It was ok. I tried this pacing thing, 10 minutes work, 5 minutes rest [✅ 5.]. It helped, but I'm still pretty tired [✅ 2. 7.2] and my muscles ache [✅ 2. 7.1]. It took all day.

2022-07-30 18:12:10 - John: Pretty low [✅ 7.2]. The muscle ache is worse now [✅ 7.1]. I had a bath [✅ 8.], and pasta for dinner [✅ 9.]. Just want to relax now.

2022-07-30 18:12:15 - LogChat: It sounds like you used a good pacing technique with the 10-minute work, 5-minute rest approach. Do you find that setting a specific goal for the evening helps you wind down and relax better?
2022-07-30 18:12:16 - John: Not really. I just wanted to get the living room done. Now I'm done. I'll probably just watch some TV. I slept for 8.5 hours last night, but I still woke up tired [✅ 1.]. Had my usual porridge and green tea this morning [✅ 3.]. Didn't really help much.

2022-07-30 18:12:21 - LogChat: Do you find that watching TV helps you relax, or do your thoughts tend to wander and make it harder for you to unwind?
