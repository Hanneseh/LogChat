2022-07-23 17:07:40 - LogChat: Hi John! How are you?
2022-07-23 17:07:40 - John: Not great. Tired, headachey [✅ 9.]. Just got back from getting groceries [✅ 5.].
2022-07-23 17:07:43 - CREATE: SYMPTOM LOG - Args: {"id": null, "name": "Headache", "description": null, "occurred_at": "2022-07-23T17:07:40", "intensity": 8, "duration": 120} [❌ 9.1]
2022-07-23 17:07:45 - LogChat: That sounds like a tough afternoon. Did the headache start to get worse as you got done with your grocery shopping, or did it feel more manageable once you were already home?
2022-07-23 17:07:46 - John: It got worse while I was out. The sun was really bright [✅ 8.], and I think that made it worse. I didn't wear sunglasses [✅ 8.].
2022-07-23 17:07:49 - CREATE: EXPERIENCE LOG - Args: {"id": null, "name": "Felt anxious", "description": "The sun was really bright, and I think that made it worse. I didn't wear sunglasses.", "occurred_at": "2022-07-23T17:07:46", "intensity": 8, "duration": 120} [✅ 8.1]
2022-07-23 17:07:51 - LogChat: Does the headache seem to be related to the sun's brightness, or is it more of a general response to physical activity?
2022-07-23 17:07:52 - John: Probably both. The walk is always tiring, but the sun definitely made it worse today.
2022-07-23 17:07:57 - LogChat: Are you feeling like today's walk was particularly exhausting, or is this a pattern that's happening more frequently lately?
2022-07-23 17:07:58 - John: It was worse than usual. I had to lie down for a long time after I got back.
2022-07-23 17:08:03 - LogChat: Do you think it's okay to make some extra time tomorrow to simply rest and relax, rather than trying to pack in a full schedule?
2022-07-23 17:08:04 - John: Yeah, I'm on sick leave anyway. I don't have much of a schedule these days. I mostly just try to get the basics done.
2022-07-23 17:08:10 - LogChat: Does the idea of taking extra rest and relaxation tomorrow feel like a welcome break for you, or is there something else on your mind that's making it hard to fully let loose and recharge?
2022-07-23 17:08:11 - John: It would be good. I was also trying to read about Long Covid online [✅ 11.]. That was also tiring. I don't know much about it.
2022-07-23 17:08:16 - LogChat: Does reading about Long Covid online feel like an energizing activity for you, or does it actually contribute to your fatigue?
2022-07-23 17:08:17 - John: It's tiring, but I feel like I need to learn more.
2022-07-23 17:08:23 - LogChat: Does the idea of taking extra rest and relaxation tomorrow feel like a welcome break for you, or is there something else on your mind that's making it hard to fully let loose and recharge?
2022-07-23 17:08:24 - John: A break would be good. I'm just worried about work and money. Being sick is expensive.
2022-07-23 17:08:30 - LogChat: Do you feel like you're putting too much pressure on yourself to manage work and finances, even when you're not feeling well?
2022-07-23 17:08:31 - John: Yes, probably. I don't know what else to do.
2022-07-23 17:08:37 - LogChat: Does reading about Long Covid online feel like a necessary learning process for you, or do you think you could potentially put it off for another day when you're feeling more rested?
2022-07-23 17:08:39 - John: I can put it off. It's not like I'm going to find a cure on Reddit.
2022-07-23 17:08:45 - LogChat: It sounds like the anxiety about work and finances is weighing heavily on your mind right now.
2022-07-23 17:08:46 - John: Yeah.
2022-07-23 17:08:52 - LogChat: You mentioned you were also reading about Long Covid online, which seems to be contributing to your fatigue. Are there any specific topics or aspects of Long Covid that you find particularly challenging to understand or process?
2022-07-23 17:08:54 - John: Just trying to understand what's happening to me. And what I can do about it. The doctors weren't much help.
2022-07-23 17:09:00 - LogChat: You seem to be feeling a mix of relief and worry about taking extra rest tomorrow. Can you tell me more about what specifically is worrying you about work and finances, or is it the sense of having to manage everything on your own during this challenging time?
2022-07-23 17:09:02 - John: I'm just worried about being out of work for too long. I don't have a lot of savings. And I don't want to lose my job.
2022-07-23 17:09:08 - LogChat: It can be really tough to feel like you're managing everything on your own, especially when you're not feeling well.
2022-07-23 17:09:10 - John: Yeah.
2022-07-23 17:09:17 - LogChat: It can be really tough to manage financial stress when you're not feeling well. Would you like to talk more about what specific numbers or worries are causing you the most concern, or is it just the feeling of being on your own financially that's weighing heavily on you?
2022-07-23 17:09:18 - John: I don't really want to talk about the numbers. It's just the general feeling. I'm single, so there's no one else to rely on.
2022-07-23 17:09:25 - LogChat: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the pressure to manage work and finances while you're not feeling well. Would it be helpful to break some of those tasks down into smaller, more manageable pieces while you're rested tomorrow?
