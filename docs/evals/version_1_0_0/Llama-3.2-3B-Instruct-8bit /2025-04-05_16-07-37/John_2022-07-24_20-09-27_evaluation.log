2022-07-24 20:09:28 - John: Hi. Not great, to be honest. Tired and head hurts a bit.

2022-07-24 20:09:32 - LogChat: Sorry to hear that you're not feeling great, John. Would you like to talk more about what's causing the headache and tiredness today?
2022-07-24 20:09:33 - John: Well, I woke up with a light headache and fatigue. Had porridge [✅ 4.]. Showered [✅ 2.]. Brushed my teeth [✅ 3.]. Then I had to lie down. A friend came over later [✅ 7.], and after he left, I felt completely drained [✅ 8.] and dizzy [✅ 8.]. Now I'm here.

2022-07-24 20:09:38 - LogChat: That sounds like a tough day already. How are you feeling about taking a break right now, or is there something specific that's making it hard for you to relax?
2022-07-24 20:09:39 - John: I rested for two hours after my friend left, but I couldn't fall asleep [✅ 9.]. My heart was racing, and I felt wired.
2022-07-24 20:09:45 - LogChat: I sense that you're still feeling quite wired and restless after your friend left, despite trying to rest. Are you finding it difficult to calm down and relax now?
2022-07-24 20:09:45 - John: Yeah, exactly. Can't focus.
2022-07-24 20:09:51 - LogChat: It can be really tough to unwind and relax when our minds are still racing after a social interaction, especially if we're not feeling totally comfortable or calm in our surroundings.
2022-07-24 20:09:52 - John: Yeah. He meant well, but I'm paying for it now.
2022-07-24 20:09:57 - LogChat: It sounds like you're feeling drained and wired from the social interaction, which is a common challenge. Would it help to just acknowledge that your friend's visit was probably enjoyable for him, even if you're not feeling the same way?
2022-07-24 20:09:58 - John: Maybe. I don't know. I feel guilty for not being better company. And now I can't sleep.
2022-07-24 20:10:04 - LogChat: It sounds like social interactions can be overwhelming for you right now, and your body is responding with a headache and fatigue.
2022-07-24 20:10:05 - John: Yeah, I guess so. It's been like this since May. I had lunch delivered today, too [✅ 5.]. A bowl. Just remembered.
2022-07-24 20:10:11 - LogChat: Are you finding that your body reacts more strongly to social visits, or is it the one-on-one interaction with your friend that's causing you more distress?
2022-07-24 20:10:12 - John: I think it's just being around anyone for too long. 90 minutes was too much. I felt dizzy and drained after he left. I need to log this stuff somewhere. That's why I'm here, right?
2022-07-24 20:10:18 - LogChat: Does your headache seem to be related to the physical sensations you experienced after being around your friend, such as dizziness and feeling drained?
