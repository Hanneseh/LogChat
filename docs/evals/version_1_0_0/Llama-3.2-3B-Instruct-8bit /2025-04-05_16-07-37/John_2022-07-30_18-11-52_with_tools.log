2022-07-30 18:11:57 - LogChat: How does that feel, tidying up the living room? Was it easier or harder for you than expected?
2022-07-30 18:12:08 - John: Felt good to get it done. The pacing strategy helped, I think. 10 minutes work, 5 minutes rest. But the muscle aches are worse now.

2022-07-30 18:12:13 - LogChat: It sounds like your pacing strategy is working for you in some ways, allowing you to get things done while also taking breaks to rest. Can you tell me more about what's happening with the muscle aches now that they're worse?
2022-07-30 18:12:14 - John: Yeah, the pacing helped me get it done. But now my muscles ache more. It's like a dull ache, all over. Had a warm bath, which helped a bit. I woke up with muscle aches this morning too.

2022-07-30 18:12:19 - LogChat: Do you think the warm bath was a contributing factor to how your muscles felt afterwards, or did it just provide some temporary relief?
2022-07-30 18:12:20 - John: The bath helped a bit temporarily, but the aches came back. It wasn't the cause, I don't think. I woke up with aches this morning too, before the bath.

2022-07-30 18:12:26 - LogChat: It sounds like your muscles aches have been following you, even after some rest. Are the muscle aches affecting any daily activities or plans you had for tomorrow?
2022-07-30 18:12:27 - John: Just the tidying today. No plans for tomorrow. Probably just rest. I slept 8.5 hours last night, still tired. Had porridge and green tea for breakfast. Salad for lunch, pasta for dinner.
