2022-07-24 20:47:07 - John: Hi. Not great, to be honest. Feeling pretty drained [✅ 8.].

2022-07-24 20:47:18 - LogChat: How long have you been feeling drained today?
2022-07-24 20:47:18 - John: Since I woke up, really. It got worse after my friend visited [✅ 7.] this afternoon. Talking to him took all my energy.

2022-07-24 20:47:30 - LogChat: Tough to have visitors when you're already feeling low on energy. Did you find that your friend noticed anything out of the ordinary about how you were feeling during their visit?
2022-07-24 20:47:31 - John: Yeah, he could tell I was getting tired. I started feeling dizzy [✅ 8.] and just completely out of it. That's when I told him I needed to rest. He was pretty worried.
2022-07-24 20:47:43 - LogChat: I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling drained.

Was it your usual routine or did your friend visit unexpectedly today?
2022-07-24 20:47:44 - John: He called [✅ 6.] earlier and asked how I was doing. We talked about my condition, and he offered to come over. It wasn't really planned.

2022-07-24 20:47:57 - LogChat: It sounds like your friend's visit was a bit unplanned.  Did you find that not having time to prepare or adjust your schedule before the visit made it harder for you to cope with the energy exertion?
2022-07-24 20:47:58 - John: Maybe a little. I mean, it's always nice to see him, but I definitely crashed afterwards. I think I need to manage these things better.
2022-07-24 20:48:12 - LogChat: I'm so sorry to hear that your friend's visit was a bit unplanned and that you crashed afterwards.

Are there any things you could do in the future to prepare for visits from friends, even if they're unexpected?
2022-07-24 20:48:13 - John: Not really sure. Maybe just keep visits shorter? Or try to rest more beforehand if I know someone's coming. It's hard to predict how I'll feel, though.

2022-07-24 20:48:27 - LogChat: It sounds like your friend's visit was a bit of an unexpected energy crash for you.

Do you think shortening visits or trying to rest beforehand could be a simple yet effective way for you to manage your energy and prevent those crashes in the future?
2022-07-24 20:48:28 - John: Yeah, maybe. It's worth a try. I just hate feeling like I have to limit myself all the time. It's isolating.
2022-07-24 20:48:43 - LogChat: It sounds like you're looking for ways to prepare for visits from friends and manage your energy levels better. Sometimes, it's not about limiting yourself entirely but finding small ways to make those interactions more sustainable for you.
2022-07-24 20:48:44 - John: True. It's just frustrating. Anyway, this morning I had a headache and felt fatigued. I had porridge [✅ 4.], showered [✅ 2.], brushed my teeth [✅ 3.], and then had to lie down. Later I ordered a bowl for lunch [✅ 5.].
2022-07-24 20:49:00 - LogChat: It seems like your energy levels were affected by the unexpected visit from your friend, and it's helpful that you're thinking about ways to prepare for future visits. What do you think would be a good way for you to communicate your energy needs to friends and family so they can support you better?
2022-07-24 20:49:01 - John: I don't know. I haven't really talked to them about it much. I guess I could just be honest and tell them I get tired easily. It's hard, though. I don't want to burden them.

Also, I wanted to log that my heart was racing when I was resting earlier. I couldn't fall asleep [✅ 9.] and couldn't focus.

2022-07-24 20:49:18 - LogChat: It seems like you're already thinking about communicating your energy needs to friends and family, which is a great step.

Have you had any conversations with them about what "getting tired easily" means for you, or what kinds of support they can offer?
