2022-07-23 17:39:09 - LogChat: John, it's great to hear that you're okay. Tired as usual means you've been active. Have you taken any breaks recently?
2022-07-23 17:39:10 - John: Yeah, I went grocery shopping this morning [✅ 5., ✅ 7.]. It's only a short walk [✅ 6.], but it wiped me out [✅ 9.]. Had to lie down for a while after.

It might help to break it down into smaller tasks or take more breaks during the activity. Do you think you might need to plan like this for your next trip?
2022-07-23 17:39:23 - John: I try to do it all in one go. It's only 150m [✅ 6.]. I usually make it without stopping. Today I did. But yeah, maybe I should have taken a break. It hit me harder than usual today [✅ 9.].

2022-07-23 17:39:35 - LogChat: You were quite active today, weren’t you? And it’s also great that you’re aware of your body and take breaks when needed. What about pacing? Would you find it helpful to plan activities into smaller tasks or take more breaks during them, especially for shorter trips like grocery shopping?
2022-07-23 17:39:37 - John: Maybe. I don't know. It's hard to plan when you don't know how you'll feel. Some days are better than others. Today wasn't one of the good ones.

2022-07-23 17:39:52 - John: I guess I could try taking a break next time. See if it helps. It's just frustrating, you know? It's such a short walk. It shouldn't be this hard.

2022-07-23 17:40:07 - John: I usually go every three days or so. So, probably Monday. No appointments or anything. Just trying to rest and recover. I was also reading about Long Covid online today [✅ 11.]. That took some energy too.
