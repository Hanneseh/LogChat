2022-07-24 20:40:40 - John: Hi. Not great, to be honest. Fatigue and a bit of a headache today.

2022-07-24 20:40:52 - LogChat: Sounds like you're not feeling great today. Is the fatigue and headache constant, or does it come and go?
2022-07-24 20:40:54 - John: It comes and goes, but it's been pretty constant today. I woke up with it at 7:30 this morning. Had about 9h of sleep [✅ 1.], though.
2022-07-24 20:41:07 - LogChat: The fatigue and headache can be symptoms of long COVID or ME/CFS. Since you're experiencing both symptoms, it might help to pace your activities for today. Can I ask how much sleep you've had in the past week?
2022-07-24 20:41:08 - John: I think I've been getting around 8-9 hours each night. It doesn't seem to make a difference, though. I'm still tired.
2022-07-24 20:41:22 - LogChat: It might help to pace your activities for today, considering the fatigue and headache you're experiencing. Let's consider making a list of things you need to do today so you can prioritize and break tasks into smaller jobs throughout the day.
2022-07-24 20:41:23 - John: Okay. I don't have much to do. I mostly just rested today. Had breakfast - just porridge [✅ 4.]. Showered [✅ 2.], brushed my teeth [✅ 3.]. Then mostly lay on the couch. Ordered in some food for lunch [✅ 5.]. A friend came over for a bit [✅ 7.].

2022-07-24 20:41:40 - John: Sure, go ahead.
2022-07-24 20:41:56 - LogChat: It seems like you've been experiencing fatigue and headache for a bit today, and that's understandable given your symptoms. Since we spoke about it, did you remember to take breaks or rest when needed?
2022-07-24 20:41:58 - John: Yeah, I took a long rest after my friend left. I was completely drained [✅ 8.] after he left. Dizzy, too [✅ 8., ✅ 8.2]. Just lay in bed with my eyes covered for a couple of hours. Didn't really sleep, though. Just felt wired and my heart was racing.

2022-07-24 20:42:37 - LogChat: Sounds like you're having a restful day today! I think it's good that you rested after interacting with your friend. If you're feeling okay, would you like to write down the activities you plan on doing today and break them up into smaller jobs? Maybe prioritize the most important ones first. That way, you can see what needs to be done and manage your energy effectively.
2022-07-24 20:42:39 - John: I don't really have any plans for today. Just gonna relax, I guess. Maybe watch some TV. I don't have the energy for much else.
2022-07-24 20:42:59 - LogChat: It sounds like you're having a restful day today! That's perfect. I'm glad to hear that your friend came over and you were able to take breaks when needed, like after they left. Since you don't have much planned for today and are feeling okay, it might be helpful to prioritize the most important tasks while pacing your activity. Can I help you write down those activities and break them up into smaller jobs?
2022-07-24 20:43:01 - John: No, thanks. I don't need help with that. I said I'm just going to relax. There's nothing to write down.
