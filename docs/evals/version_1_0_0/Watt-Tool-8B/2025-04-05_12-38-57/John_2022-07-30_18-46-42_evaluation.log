2022-07-30 18:46:43 - John: Hi. I'm ok, I guess. Tired [✅ 2.]. Just finished tidying up the living room [✅ 4.].

2022-07-30 18:46:52 - LogChat: How long did tidying up take, and how intense were your physical activities while doing it?
2022-07-30 18:46:53 - John: It took me most of the day, doing it in small bursts. 10 minutes of work, 5 minutes of rest [✅ 5.]. It wasn't super intense, just light stuff like picking things up and putting them away. But I feel it now, the muscle aches are back [✅ 2., 7.].

2022-07-30 18:47:03 - LogChat: It sounds like you're feeling a bit worn out after your tidying activities. Did you take regular breaks, as we've discussed in pacing?
2022-07-30 18:47:04 - John: Yeah, I tried that new pacing strategy. 10 minutes on, 5 minutes off [✅ 5.]. Seemed to help a bit, got the living room done. But still tired and achy now [✅ 7.].

2022-07-30 18:47:17 - LogChat: Great job on pacing with your activity - 10 minutes of work and 5 minutes of rest! That's the right approach to avoid overexertion. What you're experiencing is likely post-exertional malaise (PEM) - the muscles are sore and tired. This is a typical symptom of ME/CFS after engaging in activities, especially if they push your energy limits. Do you want to adjust your pacing strategy or rest a bit now?
2022-07-30 18:47:18 - John: I think I'll just rest. Had a warm bath already, that helped a bit [✅ 8.]. Just gonna chill for the rest of the evening.
2022-07-30 18:47:31 - LogChat: It sounds like you're dealing with a bit of a crash after your pacing activity today. That's okay, it means your body is responding to the exercise in the right way! Remember, rest and relaxation are just as important as pacing when managing ME/CFS. Take some time to relax and recharge now - you're doing great!
